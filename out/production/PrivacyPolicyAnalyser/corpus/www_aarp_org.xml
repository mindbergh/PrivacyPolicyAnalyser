        <SUBTEXT>When you join AARP, we collect basic information such as your name, contact information, preferences and date of birth. We collect information about your participation in AARP activities, including member services and discounts obtained by using your membership card.
AARP also collects information on our website. We collect both information that identifies you as a particular individual (“personally identifiable information”) and anonymous information that is not associated with a specific individual (“nonpersonally identifiable information”). When you visit our website, some information may be collected automatically as part of the site's operation. We also collect information we receive from you during online registration and when you complete other forms. In the following sections, we explain in more detail the types of information we collect online.
Information we collect automatically on our website. AARP may collect certain information automatically (either directly, through the use of cookies and Web beacons or through the use of third-party service providers, agents or independent contractors who help us maintain our websites and provide other administrative services to us). This information includes:
•	Your browser type and language, and operating system
•	Your Internet Protocol (IP) address, which is the number automatically assigned to your computer whenever you access the Internet and that can sometimes be used to derive your general geographic area
•	The times that you visit our website
•	Information about areas of our website you visited
•	The sites you visited immediately before and after visiting our website
•	Web pages and advertisements you view and links you click on within our website
•	Unique identifiers when using a mobile device, including mobile device identification numbers
•	Information that can identify the physical location of your mobile device in accordance with applicable law and industry guidelines and best practices. We will seek your permission before we identify the physical location of your device and before we engage in any continuous tracking of your device's location.
•	Information collected through cookies, Web beacons and other technologies

•	A “cookie” is a piece of information a website sends to your computer while you are viewing the website that allows the site to recognize your computer each time you visit. You have the choice to set your browser to accept all cookies, reject all cookies or notify you when a cookie is set. (Each browser is different, so check the "Help" menu of your browser to learn how to change your cookie preferences.) It is up to you whether to allow us to send you cookies. However, if you do not accept cookies from us, your ability to use some areas of our site will be limited, such as our tools and other online features.
•	Web beacons (sometimes called transparent GIFs, clear GIFs or Web bugs) are small strings of code that provide a way for us to deliver a small graphic image (usually invisible) on a Web page or in an email. Web beacons can recognize certain types of information on your computer such as cookies, the time and date a page is viewed, and a description of the page where the Web beacon is placed.
•	Information about your interactions with email messages, such as the links clicked on and whether the messages were opened or forwarded
•	Upon request for assistance, your bandwidth speed and information about the software programs installed on your computer
•	Standard server log information

        <SUBTEXT>We may allow third-party analytics companies, research companies or ad networks to collect nonpersonally identifiable information on our website.

        <SUBTITLE>With Whom We Share Your Information</SUBTITLE>
        <SUBTEXT>AARP is committed to maintaining your trust and we want you to understand when and with whom we may share information we collect about you.
AARP May Share Your Information With:
•	Service Providers. Service Providers are third parties with whom we may work to offer a service or feature, such as LinkedIn. You can tell when you are accessing a service offered by a Service Provider because the Service Provider's name will be featured prominently. You may be asked to provide information about yourself to register for a service offered by a Service Provider. In doing so, you may be providing your information to both us and the Service Provider, or we may share your information with the Service Provider. Please note that the Service Provider's privacy policy may apply to its use of your information.
•	Licensed Providers. Licensed providers are third parties who make available special AARP-branded discounts, products or services. Some of the licensed providers of AARP-branded products and services, including many of those listed on the Member Benefits page on AARP.org, pay a fee for access to our membership list. These fees are used for the general purposes of AARP. Licensed providers are required to keep AARP member information confidential, and to use the information only to offer the contracted products or services to AARP and AARP members. Some of our licensed providers may also collect data about our members through their interactions with the members. The licensed providers may share some or all of this data with AARP so that we may make available more effective and personalized service to our members. We may share information including personally identifiable information collected with Licensed Providers, even if you are not an AARP member.
•	Corporate Affiliates. We may share information including your personally identifiable information with wholly or majority owned affiliates or other affiliated organizations, such as AARP Foundation, AARP's charitable affiliate, so they can provide you with information about services and programs that might interest you.
•	Approved Vendors. We may share your information including your personally identifiable information with companies we hire to provide certain administrative services such as processing address labels, managing databases and sending mailings.
•	Selected Nonprofit Organizations. We may occasionally engage in “list exchanges” with selected nonprofit organizations in which we may share your information including your personally identifiable information.
•	Aggregate Data. We may share aggregate statistics and other nonpersonally identifiable information with the media, government agencies, advertisers and other third parties. These aggregate statistics will not allow anyone to identify your name or other personally identifiable information.
AARP May Share Your Information With Other Third Parties:
•	Pursuant to Legal Requirements. AARP will disclose your personally identifiable information in response to a subpoena or similar investigative demand, a court order, or a request for cooperation from a law enforcement agency or other government agency; to establish or exercise our legal rights; to defend against legal claims; or as otherwise required by law.
•	To Protect Our Website and Users. We will disclose your personally identifiable information when we believe disclosure is necessary to investigate, prevent or take action regarding illegal activity, suspected fraud or other wrongdoing; to protect and defend the rights, property or safety of our company, our employees, our website users or others; or to enforce our website terms and conditions or other agreements or policies.
•	In Connection With Business Transfers. We may share your personally identifiable information as required by law, such as in response to a subpoena or court order or in the unlikely event of a substantial corporate transaction, such as the sale of AARP or our affiliates, a merger, consolidation, asset sale or bankruptcy.</SUBTEXT>

    <SECTION>
        <SUBTITLE>How We Keep Your Information Secure</SUBTITLE>
        <SUBTEXT>AARP uses commercially reasonable physical, procedural and technological security measures to help prevent unauthorized access to and improper use of the information we collect about you. For example, only authorized employees and authorized third parties are permitted to access personally identifiable information, and they may do so only for lawful purposes. When we share aggregate data with third parties we prohibit them from reengineering nonpersonal data to permit identification of individual users. We maintain physical, electronic and procedural safeguards that comply with federal standards to guard your nonpublic personal information. However, no website or Internet network can be completely secure. Although we take steps to secure your information, we do not guarantee, and you should not expect, that your personal information, searches or other communications will always remain secure. Please refer to the U.S. Federal Trade Commission's website for information on how to protect yourself from identity theft.</SUBTEXT>

        <SUBTITLE>How You Can Keep More of Your Information Private</SUBTITLE>

If you choose to share contact information with us, you will have the opportunity to update or delete that information or to shut down your account by clicking on Update My Profile.
You may request that we not share personally identifiable information about you with Licensed Providers, Corporate Affiliates and Selected Nonprofits at any time, by clicking here. It may take up to 12 weeks to complete this process. Note that we may still share your information with Other Third Parties when necessary (see section 5 of this Privacy Policy).
You may request to stop receiving communications from us by clicking here. Please note that if you opt out of receiving communications from us, you may continue to receive material from Service Providers, and/or other parties to whom we provided your information before processing your request to opt-out of communications. You will need to directly contact those third parties in order to opt out of receiving such communications. You also may opt out of receiving such emails by clicking on the "unsubscribe" link within the text of those third-party emails.
Do Not Track: AARP is in favor of the development of a Do Not Track standard that gives consumers control over the collection and use of Web-browsing information. When such a standard is finalized, AARP intends to respond to Do Not Track browser settings accordingly. Seewww.AllAboutDNT.org for more information.
