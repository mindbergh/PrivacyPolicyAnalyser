We use cookies to collect information about how people use our website (for example, how many people have visited a particular part of our website or how long they spend looking at certain pages). This type of information is really useful because it helps us to understand which parts of our website are popular so that we can make it better.

We also use cookies to make your visit to our website better, for example by letting the website remember your choices or your name when you return to the website.

You can tell your computer not to accept cookies from our website. If you do decide not to accept cookies from our website, it's possible that some of the parts of our website might not work as well.

        <SUBTITLE>How do we use your personal information</SUBTITLE>
        <SUBTEXT>We may use your personal information to answer your queries or run a competition that you may have entered (e.g. so that we can let you know if you have won anything, send you your prizes, and let other people know who the winner was).

If you send us anything to appear on our website, we may use your name, so that we can give you credit for the thing you sent us.

If you provide us with any information about your interests, we may use it to decide what types of books we should be publishing in the future.

We may also use your personal information to learn more about the type of people who are interested in our website and our books.

When you give us your personal information, it may get sent to other countries (some of which might be outside of Europe) so it can be stored on computers there. Some countries outside of Europe don't have laws which protect your personal information in the same way as European countries do. However, whenever we do send your personal information to other countries, we'll take steps to ensure that it's treated securely and in accordance with this privacy policy.

We try to keep your personal information safe and secure. However, please note that the internet is not completely secure and we are not responsible for anything that happens to your personal information as it is being sent from your computer to us.</SUBTEXT>

        <SUBTITLE>Will we ever give your personal information to someone else</SUBTITLE>
        <SUBTEXT>We are part of a group of companies, so we may occasionally give your personal information to other companies within our group, where, for example, we reorganise the way our group of companies is structured.

Generally, your personal information will only be used by people who work for us (some of whom may work in our offices abroad). However, we also use various other companies to provide services to us (e.g. to run some of the technical parts of our website), some of those companies may need to have access to your personal information so they can do their job – however we will always require them to treat your personal information securely.

If another company wants to buy our company (or certain parts of it), we may provide your personal information to that company.

We may also need to give your personal information to someone else if we have to do so for legal reasons.</SUBTEXT>
