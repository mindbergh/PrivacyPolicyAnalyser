This Privacy Policy was last updated on April 15, 2013

This Privacy Policy (“Privacy Policy”) explains how Udemy, Inc. (“Udemy,” “we” or “us”) collect, use and share personally identifiable information of visitors of our web site (the “Site”) and users of our products and services (the “Services”). Please note that the primary purpose of our Site and the Services it to allow you to enroll in and take online courses on a variety of topics (“Courses”). For the purpose of this Privacy Policy, information that you provide through the Site can be in one of two categories: information relating to your use of the Site or the Services, including, without limitation, enrollment information for Courses, is referred to as “Site Information,” while information relating to taking the Courses, including, without limitation, interchanges with the Course instructors (“Instructors”), other students (“Users”), answers, essays and other items submitted to satisfy Course requirements, is referred to as “Course Information.” When this Privacy Policy uses the generic term “information” it is intended to address the general use of information, and not your specific Site Information or Course Information. By using the Site, Services, or Courses you consent to the collection, use and disclosure of your personally identifiable Site Information and Course Information, as applicable, in accordance with this Privacy Policy.</SUBTEXT>

        <SUBTITLE>Personally Identifiable Information We Collect and How We Use It</SUBTITLE>
        <SUBTEXT>You can generally visit the Site without revealing any personally identifiable information about yourself. We do not collect personal information from our Site visitors without the Site visitor providing us with this information as set forth in this Privacy Policy.

If you request to receive company or product information, or request information about specific Services, or provide comments about Services, you will be asked to provide contact information so that we can complete your request. We use this Site Information to fulfill your request. We may also use this Site Information to send you additional information about our Services or Courses on the Site that you may be interested in.

Some of the Services require that you become a registered user and create a user account. This will require that you provide certain personally identifiable information, that may include (but not be limited to) your (and if you are enrolling as part of our Udemy for Organizations program) your company's name, e-mail address, as well as telephone and address information.

You allow us to use this personally identifiable Site Information to register you to use the Services, enroll in Courses, and otherwise provide you with the Services; verify your authority to enter the Site and access the Courses and Services; notify you of updates; improve the content and general administration of the Site and the Services; provide you with notices regarding the Services and other services that you have purchased or may wish to purchase in the future.

You also consent to our providing this personally identifiable information to Instructors as part of the Course Information when you enroll in a Course. Instructors will use this Course Information to provide the Course to you. Instructors may have other users for Course Information. It is your responsibility when you enroll in a Course to confirm what uses the Instructor will make of your personally identifiable Course Information. Udemy does not control these uses by Instructors.</SUBTEXT>

        <SUBTITLE>Other Information We Collect and How We Use It</SUBTITLE>
        <SUBTEXT>Udemy may also automatically collect and analyze Site Information about your general usage of the Site, Services and Courses. We might track your usage patterns to see what features of the Site, Services and Courses you commonly use, Site traffic volume, frequency of visits, type and time of transactions, type of browser, browser language, IP address and operating system, and statistical information about how you use the Services and Courses. We only collect, track and analyze such Site Information in an aggregate manner that does not personally identify you. This aggregate data may be used to assist us in operating the Site and the Services and provided to other third parties to enable them to better understand the operation of the Services, and improve their Course offerings, but such information will be in aggregate form only and it will not contain personally identifiable data.

Instructors may collect non-personally identifiable Course Information in connection with your participation in Courses. This Course Information may include, but not be limited to, your interaction with the Instructor and other Users, comments you leave on Course forums, answers or essays you submit to satisfy Course requirements, and so forth. As noted above, it is your responsibility to review the Instructor's policy in connection with all Course Information and decide whether or not you want to provide such Course Information.</SUBTEXT>
