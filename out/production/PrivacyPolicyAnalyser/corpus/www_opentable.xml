We may also obtain information from other sources, such as third-party sites, applications and services (each, a “Third-Party Platform”) through which you connect with us, and combine that with information we collect on our Sites.

When you visit our Sites, some information is automatically collected. For example, when you visit our Sites your location, computer's operating system, Internet Protocol (IP) address, access times, browser type and language, and the website you visited before our site may be logged automatically. We also collect information about your usage and activity on our Sites and services.

Cookies.  We may automatically collect information using “cookies” and similar technology. Cookies are small data files that may have unique identifiers, and reside, among other places, on your computer or mobile device, in emails we send to you, and on our web pages. Among other things, cookies help us improve our Sites and your experience. We use cookies to see which areas and features are popular and to count visits to our Sites. We may access information contained in cookies placed on your device by a Third-Party Platform as permitted by the terms of your agreement and privacy settings with such Third-Party Platform. We may share this information with the Third-Party Platform for their use as permitted by the terms of your agreement and privacy settings with such Third-Party Platform.

Web Beacons.  We may collect information using Web beacons. Web beacons are electronic images that may be used on our Sites or in our emails.

        <SUBTITLE>HOW WE SHARE INFORMATION</SUBTITLE>
        <SUBTEXT>Information Shared With Restaurants

When you make a reservation through our Sites, your information is provided to us and to the restaurants with whom you choose to reserve.  In order to facilitate your reservation, your information is provided to that restaurant, just as it would if you made a reservation over the phone, by email to the restaurant or on the restaurant's website. If you provide a mobile phone number, restaurants may send you text messages regarding your reservation. Some restaurants also require you to provide a credit card number to secure your reservation.  We may also share with the restaurants additional information such as information about your dining preferences and history, or information that we collect via Third-Party Platforms.  You also have the option of making special preferences or comments about your reservation that OpenTable will pass on to that restaurant.

We may share with restaurants summary reports of feedback from recent diners. If you provide comments about a restaurant, these will be shared with that restaurant. We will not tie your comments with other information that can identify you, but a restaurant may be able to tell who you are from your comments, particularly, if you give your name in the comments or provide contact information such as an email address.

Information you choose to share with a restaurant when you make a reservation may be used by the restaurant for their own purposes. OpenTable does not control the privacy practices of restaurants. Please contact the restaurant directly if you want to learn about their privacy practices.

Information Shared With Gift Card Merchants

If you purchase a Gift Card from OpenTable, we notify the applicable Merchant and provide them with certain related information about your purchase, including your name, your email address, the amount of the purchased Gift Card and the Gift Card recipient's name.

Credit Card Information

For certain services on our Sites, such as for making reservations at certain restaurants and for purchases of Gift Cards or other products or services, a credit or debit card number may be required.  By submitting your card information through the Sites, you expressly agree to these terms.

When you use a credit or debit card to secure a reservation, we provide your card information (including card number, CVV number, expiration date and billing details) to our payment gateway provider and the applicable restaurant.
If you purchase Gift Cards or other products or services from us, we collect the same card information.  We share this information with our payment service providers in order to process your payments.  These third parties may also store your card information, other than your CVV number, for your future use on the Sites.  Your CVV number will not be stored and must be re-entered for each order.
For information about the security of your card information, see “Security of Your Personal Information below”.

Information You Share Socially

Our Sites may allow you to connect and share your actions, comments, content, and information publicly or with friends. We may also allow you to connect with us, share on and use Third-Party Platforms, including those on which OpenTable has a presence.

Please be mindful of your own privacy needs and the privacy needs of others as you choose whom to connect with and what to share and make public. We cannot control the privacy or security of information you choose to make public or share with others. OpenTable also does not control the privacy practices of Third-Party Platforms. Please contact those sites and services directly if you want to learn about their privacy practices.

Sharing with Others

We do not share your personal information with third parties other than as described above and as follows:

We may share personal information when you agree to our sharing of your information with other third parties (such as the restaurants at which you make reservations) for their own marketing purposes subject to their separate privacy policies.
We may share personal information with affiliates, third-party vendors, consultants and other service providers who work for us.
We may share your credit card information with third parties as described in “Credit Card Information” above.
We may share aggregate statistical data for the improvement of services offered by the OpenTable Sites.
We also use the services of third parties to provide us with services such as data collection, reporting, ad response measurement, and site analytics, as well as to assist with delivery of relevant marketing messages and advertisements. These third parties may view, edit or set their own cookies. We, our third party service providers, advertisers and/or partners may also place web beacons for these third parties. The use of these technologies by these third parties is subject to their own privacy policies and is not covered by this privacy statement.
We may disclose your personal information to (i) comply with laws or to respond to lawful requests and legal process, (ii) to protect the rights and property of OpenTable, our agents, customers, and others including to enforce our agreements, policies and terms of use or (iii) in an emergency to protect the personal safety of OpenTable, its customers, or any person.

        <SUBTITLE>SECURITY OF YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION</SUBTITLE>
        <SUBTEXT>OpenTable takes reasonable steps to help protect your personal information in an effort to prevent loss, misuse, unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration and destruction.

This also applies to your credit or debit card information.  To be clear, OpenTable does not itself store this information and we do not have direct control or responsibility for your card information.  Our contracts with third parties that receive your card information require them to keep it secure and confidential.

Nonetheless, we cannot guarantee that transmissions of your card information or personal information will always be secure or that unauthorized third parties will never be able to defeat the security measures taken by OpenTable or our third party service providers.
