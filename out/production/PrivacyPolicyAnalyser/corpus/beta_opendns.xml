        <SUBTITLE>Information You Provide Us</SUBTITLE>
        <SUBTEXT>In order to provide you with the Services we may ask you for Personally Identifiable Information ("Personal Information"). Personal Information includes but is not limited to your name and email address. Depending on the Services you request, Personal Information may also include addresses, phone numbers, IP addresses, credit card information, usernames, passwords, and other information you provide voluntarily that may be considered Personal Information. OpenDNS collects and uses such information only insofar as is it deems reasonably necessary in order to provide our Services, for us to manage and send you notices regarding your account, and for us to send you notices regarding the Services. Subject to compliance with applicable law or contractual obligations, this information will be stored for as long as necessary to provide these Services plus a reasonable time thereafter to comply with our archiving and restoration policies.
If you email us through any of the contact us links on our Website, if you submit a request for information through our Website or if you submit a support ticket through our Website we may ask you for Personal Information including but not limited to your name and email address in order to respond to your questions, comments and requests. If you choose to correspond with us via email, we may retain the content of your email messages, your email address and our correspondence with you.
If you participate in an OpenDNS referral program such as our tell a friend program, you may provide us with your friend's email address and any Personal Information that you voluntarily include in your email message to your friend or to OpenDNS. We use such information to send a one-time email to your friend regarding OpenDNS and our services and products. We store the information for the purpose of tracking the success of the referral program.</SUBTEXT>

        <SUBTITLE>Service Usage Information</SUBTITLE>
        <SUBTEXT>When you use our Services, OpenDNS stores certain DNS, IP address and related information about you to improve the quality of our Service, to provide you with Services and for internal business and analysis purposes. For example, OpenDNS runs a Domain Name System (DNS) service. DNS translates a domain name (e.g., http://www.example.com) into the corresponding numerical address (e.g., 192.0.34.166) that allows your system to access the domain over the network.</SUBTEXT>

        <SUBTITLE>Cookies, Clear GIFs, Clickstream and Browser Information</SUBTITLE>
        <SUBTEXT>We may use "cookies" on or in conjunction with our Websites to help OpenDNS identify and track visitors, their usage of our Websites, and their website access preferences. A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor's computer, and that the visitor's browser provides to the website each time the visitor returns. If you do not wish to have cookies placed on your computer you should set your browser to refuse cookies before using the Websites, with the drawback that certain features of the Websites may not function properly without the aid of cookies. We do not link the information we store in cookies to any Personal Information you submit while on our Websites.
OpenDNS does not control cookies in third-party ads, and you are encouraged to check the privacy policies of advertisers and/or ad services to learn about their use of cookies and other technology. The ads appearing on our Websites may be delivered to you by third-party advertising companies.
Our third-party advertising partners employ a software technology called clear gifs (a.k.a. Web Beacons/Web Bugs), that help us better manage content on our Website by informing us what content is effective. Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of web users. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user's computer hard drive, clear gifs are embedded invisibly on web pages and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence. We do not tie the information gathered by clear gifs to your Personal Information.
We may receive, collect and store certain other types of information whenever you interact with us and our Websites, including, without limitation, your Internet Protocol address, your domain name, the pages you visit on the Websites; other information such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, the date and time of each visitor request and any search terms you have entered on our Website or a referral website; and other web usage activity and data logged by our web servers. OpenDNS uses this information to better understand how OpenDNS' visitors use its Websites, for internal system and website administration and to provide our security Services (in aggregate and anonymous form only). We do not tie this information to your Personal Information.
We may use third-party cookies as part of remarketing activities we conduct with Google and/or other third-party vendors, to help provide you with relevant promotional offers as you use the Internet. As part of these remarketing activities, these third-party cookies may record your visits to our Websites and web sites visited prior to using our Websites. Such cookies can then be used to serve advertisements to you on other web sites. You may choose to be exempt from the use of Google remarketing cookies at the Google advertising privacy page. Alternatively, you may opt-out of remarketing on the Google network and similar networks at the Network Advertising Initiative opt out page. Opting out will not prevent advertisements from being served to you on the Internet; it will only affect advertisements that utilize remarketing cookies to serve advertisements on the specified advertising networks. We are not responsible for the activities of other parties that may not comply with your opt-out requests.</SUBTEXT>

        <SUBTITLE>Chat Rooms, Discussion Forums, Bulletin Boards</SUBTITLE>
        <SUBTEXT>If you participate in one of our chat rooms, discussion forums, or post messages to a Website bulletin board, you should be aware that the information disclosed and shared will be broadly available to other persons, both inside of and/or outside of OpenDNS, who have access to that chat room, forum or bulletin board. Please be careful and responsible whenever you're online by not posting any more Personal Information than you want revealed. In addition, if you post Personal Information online that is accessible to the public, you may receive unsolicited messages from other parties in return. Please also note that a participant's expressed opinion is his or her own and should not be considered to reflect the opinion of OpenDNS. To request removal of your personal information from our blog or community forum, contact us at contact@opendns.com. In some cases, we may not be able to remove your personal information, in which case we will let you know if we are unable to do so and why.</SUBTEXT>
