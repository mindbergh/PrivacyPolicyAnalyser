How does Wells Fargo protect my personal information?

To protect your personal information from unauthorized access and use, we use security measures that comply with federal law. These measures include computer safeguards and secured files and buildings. For more information, visit wellsfargo.com/privacy-security

How does Wells Fargo protect my personal information?

We collect your personal information, for example, when you:

Sharing for affiliates' everyday business purposes — information about your creditworthiness
Affiliates from using your information to market to you
Sharing for nonaffiliates to market to you
State laws and individual companies may give you additional rights to limit sharing. See below for more on your rights under state law.
