We do track information provided to us by your browser, including the web site you came from (known as the referring URL), the type of browser you use, the time and date of access, and other information that does not personally identify you.

In addition, we gather information about you that is automatically collected by our web server, such as your IP address, domain name and pages that you access. Breitbart.com may use web server and browser information to individually customize its offerings and presentations if you submit your personal information.

We may also collect personal information, including your name, cell phone number, e-mail address, and certain demographic data, only when you choose to voluntarily provide to us such information, such as by registering, making inquiries regarding our services, requesting breaking news alerts, reporting any problems with our Site, providing us with feedback on our Site, or otherwise.

We do not collect information through "cookies", but our advertisers may collect cookies when you click through the advertisement to their website. Cookies are small strings of text sent by the site to your browser which are then stored by your browser on your computer's hard drive. Amongst other things, Advertisers use cookies to understand how you and others are using their site, to identify repeat visitors, and to determine the paths visitors take on their site. They also use cookies to determine whether you visited their site from a particular Internet link or advertisement.

Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but it is possible to change your browser setup to allow you to control whether you will accept cookies, reject cookies, or to notify you each time a cookie is sent to you. If your browser is set to reject cookies, the advertiser may not recognize you when you return to their site. The Help section of your browser will tell you how to prevent your browser from accepting cookies".

How We Protect Your Information:
We use industry-accepted technology to protect your data from disclosure to unauthorized third parties.
