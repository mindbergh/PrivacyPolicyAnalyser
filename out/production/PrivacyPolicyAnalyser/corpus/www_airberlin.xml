        <SUBTITLE>Forwarding of data relating to flights to non-EU countries</SUBTITLE>
        <SUBTEXT>When landing in certain destination countries, airberlin is required by law to pass on certain information about passengers to the security services of the country in question. Destination countries require airlines to pass on the following records, either individually or in combination:
"Advanced Passenger Information", or API data
"Passenger Name Record", or PNR data
"Secure Flight".

1. Advanced Passenger Information
The following countries which are served by airberlin currently require the submission of Advanced Passenger Information (API): China, Denmark, Finland, Dominican Republic, Jamaica, Canada, Cuba, India, Mexico, Norway, Austria, Russia, Sweden, USA, United Kingdom and United Arab Emirates.
For flights crossing the Schengen zone border into the EU, the EU Member States can demand that API data are sent in advance.  The provision of this information to the authorities, in the case of Germany to the police authorities, is designed to make it easier to enter the country legally and at the same time prevent illegal entry.
airberlin deletes its API data once it has been passed on to the police authorities in Germany or to the foreign authorities, after an interval of maximum 48 hours.
API data include information about the passenger's identity and details of travel documents. The exact data record varies from one country to another. Some countries also require information about the flight route and the number of passengers travelling together.

2. Passenger Name Record
For flights between the USA and the EU, airberlin is required to forward the Passenger Name Record ("PNR") to the customs authorities and the US Department of Homeland Security ("DHS"). The US customs authorities and the DHS use the data to defend against terrorism and combat cross-border crime.
The PNR contains travel and booing data, as well as information about the identity of the passenger. In particular, the date on which the PNR was first compiled and any subsequent changes are recorded. The PNR contains specific data relating to the flight (inc. route, flight number, departure and arrival times, flight duration, aircraft type, booking class), information relating to the identity of the passenger or passengers (name, address and contact number in place of residence and destination, information about certain supplementary services), information about the booking of the flight (payment method, invoice address, frequent flyer entry, name of the booking agency, name of the employee, codeshare information), as well as other flight-related data, such as baggage tag numbers.
The EU and the USA have reached an agreement » which forms the legal basis for the sharing of PNR data. Germany has implemented the terms of this agreement in national law. airberlin is therefore required to forward the data to the USA.
For flights between Canada and the EU, under an agreement reached between the EU and Canada, airberlin must add certain information contained in the PNR to the API and forward it to the Canadian security services.

3. Secure Flight
For flights in and over the USA, airberlin is required to forward personal data such as the names, sex and date of birth of a passenger to the Transportation Security Administration. If available, their "Redress Number" is also passed on. The transportation authorities require the data to increase the safety of air traffic. The transportation authorities are entitled to pass on the data to other US security services. The legal basis is provided by the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act. airberlin must also forward this data to the transportation authorities if the flight does not land in the USA, but flies through US air space.

        <SUBTITLE>Cookies</SUBTITLE>
        <SUBTEXT>By using the airberlin website you accept that cookies are used as described below and that the pseudonymised data is saved for the purposes stated below even after your visit to the website has ended.
Permission to collect and store data using cookies may be revoked at any time with future effect by adapting your browser settings in such a way that your browser refuses to accept cookies.

1. Web analysis, Retargeting, Third party cookies

Cookies are small text files that are stored locally in the cache of the website visitor's internet browser. Cookies allow the internet browser to be recognised. There are different kinds of cookies, on the one hand, so-called session cookies, which are deleted once you close your browser, and on the other hand, temporary/permanent cookies, which are stored on your data carrier for a longer period of time or permanently.
On the one hand, airberlin uses session cookies, which are automatically deleted from the visitor's hard drive at the end of the browser session (end of the visit to the website). Session cookies are needed, for example, to enable customers to make flight bookings which extend over several pages.
In addition to this, airberlin also uses cookies which are stored for a longer period of time on the website visitor's hard drive. When the airberlin.com website is visited the next time, these cookies then recognise that the user has visited the site before and which entries and settings were given preference on previous occasions. These temporary or permanent cookies (which may have a lifetime of up to a year) are saved on the hard drive and are deleted automatically at the end of the specified time. These cookies are intended to make the airberlin.com websites more user-friendly, more effective and more secure and to help them meet customers' needs in the best possible way. In order to do this, they make it possible, without personally identifying the website visitor, to address targeted advertising to each internet browser, where an interest has already been shown in certain products. When a cookie is activated it is assigned a user ID. Personal data such as name, IP address or similar data are not associated with this user ID in any way and this is also not the intention. Only pseudonymised data is collected and saved using this cookie technology, such as which products are searched for, viewed or selected. On our websites technologies supplied by, e.g., etracker GmbH (www.etracker.com), doubleclick (http://www.google.com/doubleclick), Google Analytics (http://www.google.com/analytics/) or Maxymiser (www.maxymiser.com) are used. These record information on topics such as which web pages you have visited in the past or which products you have shown an interest in, so that adverts can be displayed which correspond as far as possible to the interests of the website visitor, without, of course, allowing the pseudonymised data to be linked to personal data.
It is possible that the data you have entered may be shared and used by third party suppliers through third party offers which we make available. This will also only happen in anonymised form and no link can be made at any time to your personal data. We work with various advertising partners on the basis of retargeting technologies. These help us to constantly improve the product and services we offer. In particular it allows us to address any internet browser which has already shown interest in our products with promotion campaigns, without personally identifying the visitor to the respective website. Studies have shown that displaying interest-based advertising holds more appeal for internet users than advertising which is not necessarily related to the user‘s interests. With retargeting, the display of promotional material is related to a cookie-based analysis of behaviour on previous visits, when a user profile was created under a pseudonym. On our websites technologies supplied by the following advertising partners are used: criteo (www.criteo.com), YD World (www.ydworld.com), adara media (www.adaramedia.com).
Permission to collect and store data using cookies may be revoked at any time with future effect by disabling the use of cookies for the respective supplier via the following links:

These plugins are identified by a Facebook logo or the phrase "Facebook Social Plugin". When you access a page on our website that contains one of these plugins, your browser sets up a direct link to the Facebook server and Facebook transmits the content of the plugin directly to your browser, which then integrates the content into the web page. This means that Facebook is informed that you have accessed the particular page of our website. If you are logged into Facebook, Facebook can map the visit to your Facebook account. When you use one of the Facebook plugins, for example the "Like" button or you post a comment, information to this effect is sent directly from your browser to Facebook and saved there.
