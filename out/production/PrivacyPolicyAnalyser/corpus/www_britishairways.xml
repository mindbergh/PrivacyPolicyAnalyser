        <SUBTITLE>How do we collect data about you and your use of this website</SUBTITLE>
        <SUBTEXT>You are in control of what information we collect about you. However, if you choose not to share your information some areas of the website may not be accessible or useable.

We may ask you for information about yourself when you join the Executive Club or register online, when you book or search for tickets or other products or services, when you enter competitions or register for promotions or when you request brochures or other information. We may also invite you to complete surveys or provide us with feedback.

        <SUBTITLE>How do we use your data</SUBTITLE>
        <SUBTEXT>We use your data to improve the service we offer you and to try and ensure that you get the best out of our web-sites.
Non-marketing use

We will use the information you enter at the site for administration purposes and any other purposes made clear in the data entry forms themselves, in any relevant terms or conditions and on any pages or emails which link to such forms. If you use our online booking process we may use your personal data for the purposes explained below under the heading "How we use your booking data". If you click “Submit your these Details” below, your contact details will be used to send you servicing information related to your selection or ultimate purchase. It may also be used for customer surveys but will not be used for direct marketing unless you sign up to hear about exclusive offers.

Certain cookies sent to your browser will help us to save you time. For example, if you're halfway through a booking our cookies will allow you to browse other areas of the website and then return to your booking. If you are accessing the site from a company which has a British Airways extranet, a cookie will also help us recognise which company you are from, so that you are taken to the appropriate extranet.
Website customisation and targeting of adverts

We use the data you give us about yourself when you join the Executive Club or register online to build up a picture of your interests - we then try to ensure that when you visit the site, you don't miss the offers and information relevant to you.

British Airways and its reputable third party advertising companies will collect website usage information about visitors to our website for the purposes of statistical analysis, sales and marketing research, tracking page usage and paths used by visitors through our site, targeting the site content, targeting our marketing campaigns and direct marketing emails, targeting our Internet banner advertisements on our website and on other websites and tracking use of our Internet banner advertisements and other links from our marketing partners' websites to our website.

For this purpose, we and our third party advertising companies note information on the path you take to get to our site and on some of the pages you visit on our website (including for example the options you select and the search terms you use) through the use of cookies. For information about cookies set by British Airways and its third party advertisers (including how to opt out of receiving third party cookies) please visit our Cookie Policy.

We may also combine this web usage data with other information we have collected about you, for example, whether you have arrived at our site through a marketing email sent to an individual account, booking data and passenger name records you have entered, data about your user registration or executive club membership (if you have logged in), and web usage data stored against a previous cookie set on your machine. We store this information so that we have a better and more specific understanding of the way customers are using our site and their preferences and interests. We may use it to undertake sales and marketing research and to tailor our site, our marketing campaigns and email communications specifically to you, and your recent activity on our site.</SUBTEXT>

        <SUBTITLE>How we use your booking data</SUBTITLE>
        <SUBTEXT>We will record the personal details you submit to us in the process of making a booking or requesting a brochure. Your data will be used principally to meet your requirements. We retain the data you provide from time to time, including your purchase history and data we collect when you use our services and facilities. Your data may be used and retained for the following purposes: accounting, billing and audit, credit or other payment card verification and anti-fraud screening (which may, for example, involve the use of credit reference agency searches and nominal payment card revalidation checks), immigration and customs control, safety, security, health, administrative and legal purposes, statistical and marketing analysis, operation of frequent flyer programmes, systems testing, maintenance and development, customer surveys, customer relations and to help us in any future dealings with you, for example by identifying your requirements and preferences. For these purposes we may disclose your data to any of the following who may retain that data in accordance with applicable laws: other companies in the British Airways group, airlines and other companies involved in meeting your requirements, our oneworld partner airlines and franchisees, data processing companies, travel agents, government and enforcement agencies, credit and charge card companies, credit reference agencies and screening service providers. This may involve sending your data between different countries, including countries outside the European Economic Area, including countries where under their local laws you may have fewer legal rights.

We will not use your data to contact you for direct marketing purposes without your consent. For further information, please read Direct marketing and how can you change your marketing preference? below. However, please be aware that where you abandon a booking part-way through the booking process, we may use your contact details to contact you to understand the reasons why.
Customs and Immigration Authorities

British Airways and other airlines are required by laws in the USA and other countries to give border control agencies access to booking and travel information. Accordingly any information we hold about you and your travel arrangements may be disclosed to the customs and immigration authorities of any country in your itinerary.

For further information click here.

In addition, laws in several countries require British Airways and other airlines to collect "Advance Passenger Information" (passport and associated information) for all passengers prior to travel to or from those countries. When required British Airways will provide this information to the relevant customs and immigration authorities.

For further information click here.
Executive Club Members' data

For full details on how the data we hold on Executive Club members may be used, please read the Executive Club Terms and Conditions - clause 4.
Direct Marketing

Please see the question "Direct marketing and how can you change your marketing preference?" below.
Customer surveys

From time to time we may run customer surveys. Surveys by or on behalf of British Airways are conducted in accordance with the Market Research Society and ICC/ESOMAR guidelines. These guidelines ensure that participation in any research is confidential and voluntary and that results do not identify individual respondents. For the purpose of surveys we may combine cookie or other data with your answers but we will ensure that this does not affect the anonymity of the results.</SUBTEXT>

We may use your purchase history to communicate information we think may interest you. To improve our picture of your interests we may link the data you give us about yourself with any data we have gathered (via cookies) about your use of the site.

You can sign up for direct marketing by registering on this website. You will also be asked if you want to receive direct marketing if you join the Executive Club, and you may be asked if you make a booking with or request a brochure from one of the British Airways group companies or if you enter a competition or register for a promotion with any company in the British Airways group.

We try to ensure that customers do not receive duplicate communications even if we have more than one marketing consent from the same customer. If you are an Executive Club member and would like to receive marketing communications, we will send them to you as an Executive Club member. If you are not an Executive Club member but have signed up for marketing communications by registering online, we will communicate with you as a registered customer.

Your details may be shared within the British Airways group. The British Airways group consists of British Airways Plc and a number of subsidiary companies, including, in particular British Airways Holidays Limited.

You will not receive direct marketing from companies outside the British Airways group as a result of giving your details to us; if, in exceptional circumstances, we ever wanted to allow a third party to send you direct marketing, we would seek your consent before sharing your data with that third party.

We will normally send direct marketing by email if we have your email address, but may choose to contact you via other methods such as telephone, SMS or post.

If you would like us to stop sending direct marketing to you, we offer simple ways to do this. Whenever you receive direct marketing you will be told how to unsubscribe.

In addition, if you are an Executive Club member you can change your marketing preferences at any time by amending your membership profile online, or by telephoning or writing to the Executive Club.

If you receive marketing communications as a registered customer you can change your marketing preferences at any time by amending your profile through Change My Details.
