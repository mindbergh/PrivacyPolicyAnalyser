        <SUBTEXT>When we need to collect personally identifiable information from you to provide you with a particular service, we will ask you to voluntarily supply us with the information we need. For example, if you would like to make a reservation at one of our hotels, we will ask you for information such as name, address, telephone number, email address, credit card number, Marriott or Ritz-Carlton Rewards number (if applicable) and room preference to process your reservation. We will use your email address to send a confirmation and, if necessary, might use the other information to contact you for help in processing the reservation. We will also use your contact information to:
send you a pre-arrival message summarizing your confirmation details and providing other information about the area and the hotel;
notify you about special offers and promotions as described in this privacy statement; as well as
send you periodic satisfaction or market research surveys.

On occasion, we use third parties to provide us with additional contact information about you given the information you provided to us directly. For example, if we know your name and postal address, we may use a third party to provide us with your email address. We would then use this information for market analysis and marketing purposes.
Occasionally, you may be requested to provide personally identifiable information about others to us (for example, the name, address and contact details of your travel companion). In such cases, we rely on you to obtain that other persons' consent for disclosing their information to us and inform that other persons about us, how we will use the information and our contact details for any queries.</SUBTEXT>

We recommend that you do the following:
Forward the email to the US Federal Trade Commission at spam@uce.gov or call 1-877-FTC-HELP (1-877-382-4357) to report it. The FTC uses the spam stored in this database to pursue law enforcement actions against people who send deceptive email.
Delete the email.
If you believe "phishers" have gotten access to your personal or financial information, we recommend that you also do the following:
Change your password.
Contact credit reporting services (such as Experian, Callcredit and Equifax) and have a fraud alert attached to your credit report file. Please be aware that the perpetrator may attempt to use your information to establish accounts or obtain credit at other businesses in their name.

When we ask you for credit card data, it is transferred over a Secured Sockets Layer (SSL) line, provided you are using a SSL enabled browser such as Microsoft Internet Explorer or Mozilla Firefox. We also use SSL on other pages where you would enter personally identifiable information. This ensures that your information is encrypted as it travels over the Internet. This secure mode is enabled before any such information is transmitted from your computer or web-enabled device.

After information reaches Marriott and/or Ritz-Carlton, it is stored on a secure server that resides behind firewalls designed to block unauthorized access from outside of Marriott. Because laws applicable to personal information vary by country, our hotels or other business operations may put in place additional measures that vary depending on the applicable legal requirements. Information collected on the Web sites covered by this privacy statement is generally processed and stored in the United States.</SUBTEXT>
