        <SUBTITLE>Does Ubisoft Use Cookies, Track IP Addresses or Use Other Passive Means to Collect Information</SUBTITLE>
        <SUBTEXT>Ubisoft uses cookies on the Sites. A "cookie" is a small bit of record-keeping information that web sites often store on a user's computer. Cookies do not include people's names, e-mail addresses, or other information that is personally identifiable; they are typically used to quickly identify a user's computer and to "remember" things about the user's visit. For example, Ubisoft uses cookies to keep track of selected items in your shopping cart and to remember your login name and password. Any information collected this way is held only up until midnight of the same day, at which point, the information is deleted. You can disable cookies or set your browser to alert you when cookies are being sent to your computer, although this may affect your ability to shop online. For more information about cookies, please see http://www.allaboutcookies.org.
Ubisoft also keep tracks of Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for safety and security reasons. An IP address is a number that is used by computers on the network to identify your computer every time you log on to the Internet.
The only other information passively collected by Ubisoft is in the form of logs - files that record web site activity, including how many "hits" a particular web page is getting (a.k.a. "click-through data"). This information is used in an aggregated form and not to identify specific use patterns of you or any individual.  These entries enable Ubisoft to assess overall site activity, track interest in advertised sales, and troubleshoot technical concerns. We also use the log file entries for our internal marketing and demographic studies, so we can constantly improve the referral services we provide you.
Ubisoft may collect information regarding the user's behaviour, and his/her use of Ubisoft's demos and in-game data such as achievements, rankings, time played to better adapt our products and services to users' interests and for a better quality of our services.</SUBTEXT>

We also use your personal information for our internal marketing and demographic studies, so we can constantly improve the products and services we provide you and to better meet your needs.
From time to time, Ubisoft may employ third-party vendors, to collect personal information on Ubisoft's behalf. These third parties provide internal support to Ubisoft by operating some of the services we provide you including free email services and online product fulfillment. If we solicit third parties to collect personal information on our behalf, we require all such third parties  to comply with and adhere to this Privacy Statement. When requesting these services, you may be asked to supply your name, billing and mailing addresses, email address, credit card number and valid expiration date.
