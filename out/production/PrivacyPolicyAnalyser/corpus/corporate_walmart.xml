These analytics providers may also have access to your device-specific information such as a unique device identifier. This information will not be associated in any way with your account at Walmart or any personal information that identifies who you are, and we require these service providers to keep your information secure.

There are multiple options for users of our mobile applications to opt-out of the collection and of your precise location information:

Opt-out of all information collection by uninstalling our mobile applications â€“ You can stop all collection of information by our mobile applications easily by uninstalling the mobile applications. You may use the standard uninstall processes available as part of your mobile device or via the mobile application marketplace or network.
