Except where necessary in connection with services provided by appropriate intermediaries, who will be required to comply with the confidentiality provisions of this policy, or as expressly provided herein, Wiley will not disclose any personal information identifying Users to any third party, unless required by law or otherwise needed in connection with legal proceedings or unless we have received your consent. Personal information and any other communications or information supplied to Wiley may be used by Wiley for internal business and research purposes and to help enhance and develop our websites.

If you provide Wiley with your postal address, you may receive periodic catalogs from Wiley, or other notices containing information about new and services or upcoming events.

Wiley may disclose to carefully chosen third parties navigational and transactional information in the form of anonymous, aggregate usage statistics (including "page views" on this website and the products herein) and demographics but only in forms that do not reveal a User's or Licensee's (for Wiley InterScience customers) identity or confidential information, except as required by law, as needed in connection with legal proceedings, or unless we have received your consent. Where Wiley publishes a journal or other product on behalf of a third-party, Wiley may also disclose Licensee's identity on a confidential basis to that third-party.
