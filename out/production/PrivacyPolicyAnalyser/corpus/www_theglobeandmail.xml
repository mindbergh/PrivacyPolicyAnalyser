    <SECTION>
        <SUBTITLE>Internet Aspects:</SUBTITLE>
        <SUBTEXT>Personal Information may be collected by Globe or third-party service providers on Globe's behalf. Although information collected, used or disclosed on the Internet as described below often does not constitute Personal Information (and to the extent that such is the case, then the obligations under the Globe Privacy Code do not extend to such information), Globe provides the details below about Internet aspects of Globe Companies Services for the purposes of disclosure about Globe Companies Services.

Internet Protocol Address (IP Address)
When the user's web browser requests a web page from another computer on the Internet, it automatically gives that computer the address where it should send the information. This address is called the computer's "IP address." For most users accessing the Internet from a dial-up Internet service provider (ISP), the IP address will be different every time the user logs on.

Globe Companies may use the user's IP Address to:

facilitate the diagnosis and remedy of a technical problem reported by the user's or Globe Company's technical team.
display (or allow the display by Third Party advertising providers of) more appropriate and relevant content and advertising, such as content and advertising based on the user's geographic area, demographic profile and site session behaviour.
estimate user traffic from specific countries or organizations. Many IP addresses are commonly associated with Internet service providers, universities, or major corporations in specific regions or localities. Aggregate information derived from IP addresses may also be reported to advertisers.
Cookies
A cookie is a small text file, which often includes an anonymous unique identifier, that is sent to the user's web browser from a website's computers and is stored on the user's computer's hard drive. Cookies cannot be used to run programs or deliver viruses to a user's computer.

Globe Companies may use cookies to:

improve the operation and performance of the Globe Companies Services and to make Globe Companies Services easier and more convenient to use. For example, cookies help Globe Companies provide more personalized services by recalling user preferences on subsequent visits (e.g. language preference). Cookies also allow Globe Companies to save passwords and preferences for a user so that the user will not have to re-enter them on the next visit to a Globe Companies Site;
measure aggregate user traffic and demographic statistics related to Globe Companies Services and advertisements (e.g. number of users, average time spent, average age and similar statistics). This information helps Globe Companies to better understand when to update, change or offer new services and provides Globe Companies with details as to the performance of Third Party advertisements and content. This information may be reported, in aggregate form only, to Globe Companies' current and prospective sponsors, advertisers and business partners. No Personal Information will be disclosed in such reports;
display advertisements. Globe Companies and Third Party advertising providers may use cookies when serving advertisements on Globe Companies Sites. Anonymous data based on cookies and user IP Addresses may be used to deliver advertisements that are likely to be of interest to the applicable users ("Interest-based Advertising"). In some cases, advertisements from Third Party advertisers are delivered to users (in conjunction with Globe Companies Services) by such Third Party advertisers, or by separately contracted advertising providers on their behalf, and not by Globe Companies; as such, the Third-party advertisers' use of cookies is subject to their own privacy policies, not the Globe Privacy Code, and users should consult the privacy policies of such Third Party advertisers.
Most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies. If a user prefers, the user can reset his/her browser either to notify the user when the user has received a cookie, or to refuse to accept cookies. The user should understand that while Globe Companies do not require a user to use cookies, certain Globe Companies Services will not function properly if a user sets his/her browser to not accept cookies.

Web Beacons
Certain Globe Companies Services may contain electronic images known as Web beacons - sometimes called single-pixel gifs - that allow Globe Companies to count users who have visited those pages and to deliver co-branded services. Web beacons are not used to access Personal Information; they are a technique used to compile aggregated statistics about Globe Companies service usage. Web beacons collect only a limited set of information including a cookie number, time and date of a page view, and a description of the page on which the Web beacon resides. Certain Globe Companies Services web pages may also contain Web beacons placed there by Globe Companies' advertising partners to help Globe Companies determine the effectiveness of Globe Companies' Internet advertising campaigns.

Links To Other Sites And Advertisements
A Globe Companies Service may contain links to other websites and services. While Globe Companies try to link only to sites and services that share Globe Companies' high standards and respect for privacy, a user should understand that Globe Companies are not responsible for the content of, or the privacy practices employed by, other companies or websites. This Globe Privacy Code applies only to the Globe Companies Services related to this Globe Privacy Code.

The majority of the advertisements which are displayed in connection with Globe Companies Services are served through one or more reputable Third Party advertisement-serving companies which deliver the advertisements to users in conjunction with Globe Companies Services. For more information about what information is collected and how information is used by a major Third Party advertising provider click here.

Additional Information
Globe Companies automatically collect certain information about the user's computer hardware and software. This information may include: browser type, operating system type, domain names, access times and referring website addresses. This information is used by Globe Companies to operate the service, to maintain the quality of the service, and to provide general statistics regarding use of the Globe Companies Sites.

Certain Globe Companies Services may be co-branded and offered in conjunction with another company. If a user registers for or uses such services, both Globe Companies and the other company may receive information collected in conjunction with the co-branded services.</SUBTEXT>

"The Globe may from time to time engage outside suppliers, including technology providers."
