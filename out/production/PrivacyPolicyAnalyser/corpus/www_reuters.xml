        <SUBTITLE>How Reuters May Use Your Information</SUBTITLE>
        <SUBTEXT>Personal Information You Share With Us

“Personal Identifiable Information" is the information that identifies you as an individual, such as name, postal address, telephone number, email address, and/or credit card number.

Reuters collects Personal Information (PII) ONLY when you submit it to us, including when you register or subscribe for certain Thomson Reuters products and services, complete a survey, or participate in a forum.

The Personal Identifiable Information (PII) that Reuters collects is First Name, Last Name, Email Address, Screen Name, Street Address, Zip/Postal Code/Location, and Country. The only mandatory field above is email address when creating a Reuters account.

We also ask optional profile questions that include, Investing Background, Risk Profile, Job Title, Job Function/Occupation, Industry, and no. of Staff/Company Size. None of which are required.

The Reuters Loyalty Survey is another way we gather information about our users. This survey is only presented to registered users who have logged in 4 times during the last 30 days. The following questions will be presented to the user if they are selected, including what industry to do you work, what is your job title, and what size company do you work for. This survey helps us better understand our audience.

Account Registration

The minimum information we need to register a consumer is an email address and a password. We will ask further questions for different services, including sales promotions. Unless stated, all registration questions are compulsory.

We may also ask some further, voluntary questions during registration for certain services so we can gain a clearer understanding of our visitors and consumers. This also enables us to personalize services for our visitors and consumers.

Information we Automatically Collect

Reuters automatically collects Non-Personally Identifiable Information (Non-PII) on all visitors and consumers interacting with our online services, including your IP address, browser type, operating geography, and pages visited.

If you access our Online Services from a mobile or other device, we may collect a unique device identifier assigned to that device ("UDID").

This information is used to personalize your experience across all Reuters platforms. It also allows us to display relevant content, services and advertising to the appropriate audience.</SUBTEXT>

        <SUBTITLE>Who Reuters May Share Your Information With</SUBTITLE>
        <SUBTEXT>Reuters will not share your personal information with others for marketing purposes unless you have given your permission. With your permission, we will only share your information with carefully chosen third parties.

Reuters may offer via the site third party services, such as video recommendations, article recommendations, social login, social sharing, social commenting, live news feeds, and surveys. Any information which is collected by Reuters when you access a third party service is processed under this Privacy Statement. Information collected by third party operators themselves will be governed by their own privacy statement.

Reuters may use service providers to help us run this site or services available on the site, some of whom may be based outside your country or the European Economic Area. Any third parties who access your data in the course of providing services on our behalf are subject to strict contractual restrictions to ensure that your data is protected, and in compliance with Data Privacy laws.

        <SUBTITLE>Use of Cookies</SUBTITLE>
        <SUBTEXT>Reuters use cookies and other similar anonymous tracking technologies for a number of reasons.

Reuters use anonymous cookies for statistical purposes to track how many unique consumers we have and how often they visit the Reuters sites. Reuters collect data about which of our pages are most frequently visited and by which types of visitors and consumers from which countries.
Reuters use registration cookies to track if registered consumers are logged in. This allows you to access services that require registration such as purchasing analyses or commenting on articles. You must enable Reuters to place cookies on your computer to register and use services requiring registration.
Reuters use cookies with privacy compliant third parties to collect anonymous user information. These third party cookies (flash and non-flash) and web beacons are used for video recommendations, article recommendations, social sharing and other similar services and collect information such as your IP address, browser type, operating geography, and pages visited.
Both Reuters and third party advertisers use cookies to collect anonymous statistical advertising data. This may include whether a visitor has seen an advertisement and if so, how long ago, how many have seen the advertisement once and how many have seen it more than once. Further information is available below concerning Online Behavioural Advertising.
Placing cookies on your computer means Reuters may serve you advertisements possibly more interesting to you, and allows us to control the number of times you see advertisements and measure effectiveness of ad campaigns. Further information is available below in the Online Behavioural Advertising section, including how you can opt out of online behavioural advertising.
You can turn cookies off, but if you do this, you may not be able to use some services on the Reuters site, and you might see more pop-ups and other intrusive advertising, as we won't be able to limit what you see using cookies. You will however still be able to view editorial content.

For more information on managing your cookies, including how to turn them off, please review the “Updating Your Personal Information” section above.

By permitting cookies to be used you are agreeing to the use of cookies as described above.</SUBTEXT>

        <SUBTITLE>About Reuters Advertising</SUBTITLE>
        <SUBTEXT>Online Behavioural Advertising (OBA) allows us to deliver targeted advertising to visitors to the Reuters sites. OBA works by showing you advertisements which are based on the type of content you have been reading, and delivering advertisements which we believe may be of interest to you.

As you browse Reuters, one of the cookies placed on your computer will be an advertising cookie so we can better understand what sort of pages you are interested in.

The information collected about your computer enables us to group you with other computers who have shown similar interests. We can then display advertising to you which is based on these interests. For instance if you have been reading a lot of Food and Drink articles we may decide to show you more advertisements based on food and drink.

It's important to remember that none of the OBA techniques we employ requires us to collect or use personally identifiable information like your name, email address, postal address or telephone number.

Behavioural retargeting is another form of OBA which enables us and some of our advertising partners to show you ads based on your online reading away from the Reuters site. For example, if you have visited the website of an online clothing shop you may start seeing ads from that same shopping site displaying special offers or showing you the products that you were browsing. This allows companies to advertise to visitors who are interested in their content after they leave their website.

Reuters may also want to share behavioural data with other websites. This may mean that when you are on other websites you are served advertising based on your behaviour on Reuters, and on Reuters you may be served advertising based on your behaviour on other sites.

If you want to opt out of receiving online behavioural advertising this does not mean that you will no longer receive advertising when you are using this website. It just means that the advertising you see will not be customised or relevant to you.

If you would like to manage your advertising profile, interests and learn how to opt out of online behavioural advertising, please review the “Updating Your Personal Information” section above. If you would like to further read about OBA please visit http://www.iab.net/public_policy/behavioral-advertisingprinciples.
