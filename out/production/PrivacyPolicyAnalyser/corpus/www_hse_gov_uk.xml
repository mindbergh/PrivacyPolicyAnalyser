        <SUBTEXT>HSE's functions are set out in the Health and Safety at Work Act 1974. In carrying out these functions, we necessarily collect information on businesses and individuals. You might also provide us with information by using this website, for example, by giving us feedback or sending a query or request to us. HSE is registered as a data controller under the Data Protection Act 1998 and a description of how we use personal information is included on HSE's entry link to external website on the register which is maintained by the Information Commissioner's Office link to external website.

HSE is under a legal duty to protect any personal information we collect and we will only use that information in accordance with the law, including the Data Protection Act and the Health and Safety at Work Act. We use leading technologies and encryption software to safeguard data and apply strict security standards to prevent any unauthorised access to it. In order to carry out our functions and respond to enquiries effectively, we will sometimes need to share information with other government departments, the emergency services, law enforcement agencies, public authorities (such as local authorities and the Environment Agency) and organisations acting on our behalf. However, we will only do this where it is permitted by law.</SUBTEXT>
