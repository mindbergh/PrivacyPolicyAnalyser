For convenience, the words "User," "You" and "Your" as used in this Privacy Policy refer to all users of the Site, including, without limitation, anyone that accesses or visits the Site; individuals seeking to utilize the Products and Services; and physicians, long-term care facilities, hospitals, insurers and other providers of healthcare services and persons working on their behalves who input or post or edit profiles and other content, materials and information related to them (collectivelyte and the Vitals mobile app, "Healthcare Providers").

Vitals recognizes that Your privacy and the protection of Your Personal Information (as defined below) is important to You, and, therefore, has adopted this Privacy Policy. This Privacy Policy describes Vitals' privacy practices and how Vitals treats the Personal Information that is provided by You when You use the Site or the Products and Services, including any Personal Information You provide if and when You register on or through the Site or create Your Vitals account. This Privacy Policy applies to the Site and all of the Products and Services.

For the purposes of this Privacy Policy, "Personal Information" is information that (i) You voluntarily provide to Vitals, and (ii) that personally identifies You. Personal Information includes, but is not limited to, Your name, email or other address, billing and payment information and other data that can be used to personally identify or contact You. If You decide to utilize any of the Products and Services, including, for example and where available, scheduling an appointment with a Healthcare Provider through our website or mobile application, Your Personal Information may also contain sensitive personal information, including any confidential medical information (such as your reason for scheduling the provider appointment) that You voluntarily provide, as well as information collected by Vitals as a result of Your queries, searches, clickstreams and other website or mobile application navigation activities.

"Aggregated Non-Personal Information" is information about some or all of the Users of the Products and Services, but unlike Personal Information, does not reflect or reference an individually identifiable User. Aggregated Non-Personal Information may be formed from Personal Information, but any of the Personal Information used to form the Aggregated Non-Personal Information has been processed to no longer reflect or reference an individually identifiable User.</SUBTEXT>

        <SUBTITLE>HOW VITALS USES PERSONAL INFORMATION</SUBTITLE>
        <SUBTEXT>Vitals only uses Personal Information for the purposes and in the manner described in this Privacy Policy. Specifically, Vitals only uses Your Personal Information for:

Providing the Products and Services to You, including but not limited to, the processing, formatting and displaying of Personal Information, customized content and the delivery of customized Products and Services to You;
Auditing, research and analysis in order to maintain, protect and improve the Products and Services and the Site;
Ensuring the technical functioning of Vitals' network and the Site, including creating and maintaining backups or other archival copies of Personal Information and other related data; and/or
Developing new Products and Services, which may include use of Personal Information by Vitals in connection with developing and offering to You customized Products and Services (e.g., postal mail, e-mail or other forms of electronic communications, such as "newsletters," regarding specific health conditions, health education and/or disease prevention), which Products and Services may be supported by third-party advertising from Healthcare Providers and manufacturers, retailers and/or other service providers within the healthcare industry (e.g., pharmaceutical and/or medical device manufacturers, suppliers, or retailers).
Vitals restricts access to Personal Information to those employees, contractors and agents of Vitals who need to access Personal Information for the purposes specified above. These individuals are bound by confidentiality obligations and may be subject to discipline, including termination, if they fail to meet these obligations.

Except as otherwise set forth herein, Vitals does not share Your Personal Information with third parties without Your consent, except when We believe that it is reasonably necessary to do so in order to comply with a subpoena or other judicial order or process, as otherwise required by law or in order to enforce Vitals' Terms of Use (also known as a User Agreement) for the Vitals website and mobile application ("Terms of Use"). In such circumstances, Your Personal Information may also be disclosed to Vitals' attorneys.

Aggregated Non-Personal Information provided to or collected by Vitals may be provided to, shared with and used by third parties including third-party content providers, paid advertisers and licensees of the Products and Services. Vitals permits third-party advertising companies and networks to place paid advertisements that may be visible when You visit, use or access the Site. These companies and networks include, among others, third party ad servers, ad agencies, advertising networks, advertising technology vendors, and research firms. These companies and networks may use information (not including your Personal Information) relating to Your visits to, use or access of the Site in order to provide advertisements about goods and services that may be of interest to You. In the course of serving advertisements to the Site, these companies and networks may place or recognize a unique "cookie" on your browser or within the code of the mobile application or use a "web beacon".

An example of such third-party ad networks are Google and DoubleClick. These third parties collect Aggregated Non-Personal Information about the Site's users and provide auditing, research and reporting services and information for Vitals' advertisers and other partners. If you would like more information about this practice and to know your choices about not having this information used by Google and/or DoubleClick, please visit http://www.google.com/policies/privacy/ads/.

You may also visit these sites from links included in the Privacy Policy posted on the Vitals.com website.

If Vitals desires to use or share Your Personal Information for any purpose other than those described in this Privacy Policy (as it may be amended from time to time), Vitals will request Your consent prior to such use and offer You an effective way to opt out of the use of Personal Information for those other purposes. If you opt out or otherwise decline to submit Personal Information in response to such a request, Vitals may not be able to provide to You all of its Products and Services or may have to terminate Your Vitals account, if maintenance of Your account is inconsistent with a use of Your Personal Information to which You are unwilling to consent.</SUBTEXT>

Information You Store or Access When Using the Products and Services

When you use the Products and Services, Vitals makes good faith efforts to provide you with access to Your Personal Information.

Where applicable, Vitals asks individual users to identify themselves and the information requested to be accessed, corrected or removed before processing such requests, and Vitals may decline to process requests that are unreasonably repetitive or systematic, require disproportionate technical effort, jeopardize the privacy of others, or would be extremely impractical (for instance, requests concerning information residing on backup tapes), or for which access is not otherwise required. In any case, where Vitals provides information access and correction, Vitals provides this service free of charge, except if doing so would require a disproportionate effort. If you have any questions or want more information about accessing or updating Your Personal Information, please contact Vitals by e-mail to support@vitals.com or by telephone to (201) 842-0760.

All deletions, changes or updates that you make to Your Personal Information will take immediate effect. Account terminations will also take immediate effect after Vitals receives and processes Your e-mail termination request. Except for deleted information that was stored exclusively on Your mobile device, residual copies of the deleted information, including terminated account information, may take up to sixty (60) days to be deleted from active servers and may remain in perpetuity in backup systems.

Deleting the Vitals mobile application from Your mobile device will not terminate Your Vitals account but will delete any information that You stored through the mobile application by means of taking a photograph with Your mobile device ("Stored Photographic Information"). Terminating Your Vitals account will not delete Stored Photographic Information unless You also delete the Vitals mobile application from Your mobile device.

Please note though that according to the Terms of Use, Your Submissions to Vitals should not include any "personally identifiable information (other than the name of the Healthcare Providers being reviewed)." This Privacy Policy does not apply to any Personal Information that You may nevertheless include in your Submissions and You may not be able to change or update any such Personal Information included in Your Submissions.</SUBTEXT>
