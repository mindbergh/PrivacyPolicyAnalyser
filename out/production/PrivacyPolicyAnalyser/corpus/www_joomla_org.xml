The Joomla! project and the legal entity Open Source Matters maintain a number of websites, including the joomla.org domain and subdomains, joomlacode.org and opensourcematters.org. We are committed to maintaining your privacy as you use these sites. To better protect your privacy we provide this notice explaining our online information practices and the choices you can make about the way your information is collected and used. To make this notice easy to find, we make it available on our homepage and at every point where personally identifiable information may be requested.

On all of our sites, we use non-personally identifiable and aggregate information to better design our sites. On all of our sites at which we collect personally identifiable information through the site registration process you can correct or modify that information by editing your user profile. We have appropriate security measures in place in our physical facilities to protect against the loss, misuse or alteration of information that we have collected from you at our site.</SUBTEXT>

        <SUBTITLE>Privacy on specific Joomla! sites</SUBTITLE>
        <SUBTEXT>On some sites, including extensions.joomla.org, forums.joomla.org, docs.joomla.org, developer.joomla.org and joomlacode.org you will be asked to provide an email address when registering for an account.

If you register at forum.joomla.org you can choose whether to allow other forum members to contact you by email or private messaging and the type of personal information that is available using your user profile. You can also opt to subscribe to specific forums or threads which means your email address will be used to send information when new posts are made. All email from the forum site includes a link that allows you to opt out from continued subscription to that thread or forum. Forum administrators may use your email address to contact you if necessary.

Your IP address may be used to identify duplicate user accounts (which are forbidden under the forum rules).

Cookies are used to store visitors' preferences and record past activity at a site in order to provide better service when visitors return to our site, such as indicating which threads you have read. You may modify your information and preferences by editing your user profile.

If you  register projects at joomlacode.org and extensions at extensions.joomla.org you agree to separate terms of service that allows us to contact you in reference to your project, extension or account.

If you register as a user at extensions.joomla.org your IP address may be used to identify possible abuse of the reviewing and rating system.

Should you choose to edit or create wiki pages at docs.joomla.org your identity is recorded and your username is viewable by those who look at the history of the pages you have worked on. Your IP address may be used to identify possible abuse and may be blocked if abuse is detected. On docs.joomla.org you can choose to allow other users to send you email.  This feature can be disabled in your user profile.  Wiki administrators may still use your email address to contact you if necessary.  Your email address is not revealed when sending or receiving messages in this way.

On joomlacode.org, we use aggregate IP information to help us understand the geographic distribution of those downloading Joomla! and other packages. Users who are logged in to Joomlacode.org who take specific actions such as submitting an issue to a tracker or downloading a release package have their identities recorded as part of the operation of Gforge. When you register as a user on joomlacode.org or submit an issue to the tracker, your name, email address and any information you have provided during registration, and in the "My Account" page, is publicly viewable. This is part of theGforge application that we cannot modify. We suggest that you only fill in the required name and email fields.  Your email address will be used to inform you of progress on the issue you submitted.

On any of the sites with commenting features your name, email address, and IP address will be recorded when you make a comment. This information will not be published or shared with any third parties.

If you make a financial contribution to Joomla! using the sites, your name, address and other information are collected, but your credit card information is never stored on our sites. PayPal's privacy policy may be viewed here.</SUBTEXT>
