        <SUBTEXT>It is Buzznet's policy to respect the privacy of Members. We provide this Privacy Policy to inform you of our policies and procedures regarding the collection, use and disclosure of personal information we receive when you visit and use our website located at justjaredjr.buzznet.com (the “Site”). This Privacy Policy applies only to information that you provide to us through the Site, and when you access, download, purchase or use any information, services, products or content appearing on the Site. This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time. We will notify you of any material changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on the Site. You should consult this Privacy Policy regularly for any changes.

Except as otherwise provided in this Privacy Policy, we will not disclose to any member's name or contact information or Personal Information (defined below). Buzznet will also not monitor, edit, or disclose member's information unless required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to: (1) cooperate with law enforcement authorities or comply with legal process served on Buzznet; (2) to protect the property and rights of Buzznet or a third party; or (3) to protect the safety of the public or any person; (4) to prevent or stop any activity we may consider to be, or to pose a risk of being, illegal, unethical, inappropriate or legally actionable; or (5) fix or debug problems with the Buzznet servers, software or service.

Children's Privacy

The Site is not directed to children under 13 years of age, and Buzznet requires users of its service to be 13 years of age or older. Accordingly, Buzznet does not knowingly collect or maintain on its Site personally identifiable information from children under 13 years of age. If a parent or guardian becomes aware that his or her child has provided us with Personal Information without their consent, he or she should contact us at privacy@buzznet.com. If we become aware that a child under 13 has provided us with Personal Information, we will delete such information from our files.

We recommend that minors over the age of 13 ask a parent or guardian for permission before sending any information about themselves to anyone over the Internet.</SUBTEXT>

        <SUBTITLE>THE PERSONAL INFORMATION WE COLLECT</SUBTITLE>
        <SUBTEXT>When you post or register to become a member of the Site and in the course of using the Site, you may voluntarily submit personally identifiable information that can be used to contact or identify you and administer your account (“Personal Information”). Personal information may include, but is not limited to, your name, phone number and e-mail address. Buzznet may also collect Personal Information from you if you choose to opt-in to participate in sweepstakes, surveys, contests or competitions. When you register with the Site, you create your own profile and privacy settings. Your profile information, as well as your name, e-mail and photo, are displayed to people you have specified in your privacy settings. Profile information you submit to Buzznet, and make public via your privacy settings, will also be available to other Buzznet users via searching our Site, and may be available to third party search engines. This is primarily so your friends can find you and the content you create and store on Buzznet. We recommend that you guard your anonymity and sensitive information and that you not use your real name as your screen or user name to the extent that allows others to identify you.

As you use the Site, our servers automatically record information that the browser sends whenever it points to a Site or online service (“Log Data”). Log Data may include, but is not limited to, your computer's Internet Protocol address, browser type, the web page you were visiting before you came to one of the Site and information you search for on a Site.</SUBTEXT>

        <SUBTITLE>OTHER INFORMATION/LOGGING AND COOKIES</SUBTITLE>
        <SUBTEXT>Like many websites, we use “cookies” to collect information. A cookie is a small data file that we transfer to your computer's hard disk for record-keeping purposes.

We use “session ID cookies” to enable certain features of our service, to better understand how you interact with the Site and to monitor web traffic routing on the Site and aggregate usage of the Site. You can instruct your browser, by changing its options, to stop accepting cookies or to prompt you before accepting a cookie from the websites you visit. If you do not accept cookies, however, you may not be able to use all portions of the Site or all functionality of the services.

Buzznet also uses the services of a third party vendor, Omniture, to help us measure the effectiveness of our advertising and how visitors use the Site. Although Omniture logs the information coming from our Site on our behalf, Buzznet controls how that data may and may not be used. If you do not want to assist Buzznet in improving our Site, products, offers and marketing strategy, you can “opt-out” of Omnitures web-Site analysis tool by clicking here: http://buzznet.122.2O7.net/optout.html</SUBTEXT>
