        <SUBTEXT>The Lottery Post privacy policy is simple:

When browsing Lottery Post forums and messages, no personally identifying information is collected or used.
When you register as a Lottery Post Member, we will collect minimal personal information, including e-mail address and country.  Much of what we ask for is optional.
We do not provide any third party company or individual with any of the information that is posted at Lottery Post, or that is provided when you register.
When you post a message or when you register to become a member, we put a "cookie" on your PC for your convenience.  The cookie's main function is to retain your login information on your PC so you don't have to retype it the next time you post a message.  The cookie takes up practically no space on your PC hard drive, and is completely harmless.
Lottery Post is not a part of, or related in any way to, any government agency or lottery.
If you have any questions about our Privacy Statement, please contact us.</SUBTEXT>
