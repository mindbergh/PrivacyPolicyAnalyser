        <SUBTEXT>SUBSCRIBER PRIVACY POLICY

DIRECTV is dedicated to protecting our subscribers' privacy. This Privacy Policy (this “Policy”)
explains how DIRECTV collects, uses, and discloses information about our subscribers when
they subscribe to, access, or use our products and services, such as through: a set-top box or
other satellite service receiving equipment (each, a “DIRECTV Receiver”); any other device
(such as a mobile device or game console) authorized to receive our services (each, an
“Authorized Device”); or any software application, mobile application or website authorized to
receive our services (each, an “Authorized Application”). Your use of any DIRECTV product or
service constitutes your acceptance of this Policy.

This Policy does not apply to the areas of DIRECTV websites or other Authorized Applications
that are accessible to the general public, which are governed by the DIRECTV website privacy
policy (available at www.directv. com). This Policy also does not apply to information about you
that you provide or you authorize us to provide on your behalf to, or that is collected by, other
companies that allow you to receive information or to purchase or use goods or services through
a DIRECTV Receiver, an Authorized Device, or an Authorized Application. Please contact or visit
the websites of those companies to obtain copies of their privacy policies.

This Policy explains our practices in the following areas:
1. Information we collect and how we collect it.
2. How we use your information.
3. How we share your information.
4. Your choices regarding our use of your information.
5. How long we keep your information
6. How we protect your information.
7. How you may access and correct your personally identifiable information.
8. Changes to this Policy.

If you have questions about this Policy, you may contact us 24 hours a day, any day of the year,
by phone (1-800-531-5000), e-mail (www. directv.com/email), or mail:

DIRECTV Privacy Policy
P.O. Box 6550
Greenwood Village, CO 80155-6550</SUBTEXT>

    <SECTION>
        <SUBTITLE>Information we collect and how we collect it.</SUBTITLE>
        <SUBTEXT>We collect information from you at various times when you request and activate DIRECTV
service, add or change any equipment, programming package or other service, or use certain
features of our products and services, including through a DIRECTV Receiver, Authorized
Device, or Authorized Application. The types of information we collect are as follows:

Personally identifiable information. The types of personally identifiable information we may
collect from you include: name; address; email address; telephone number; Social Security
number, driver's license or other government-issued identification number; credit card number or
other financial account information; and user name and password associated with the online
account you create at any of our websites or through another Authorized Application to access
your DIRECTV service account.

Diagnostic/Servicing information. We automatically collect information about the technical
operation of DIRECTV Receivers, Authorized Devices, or Authorized Applications, such as a
DIRECTV Receiver's software version and model number, the operating system and type of
Authorized Device or Authorized Application, the type of browser used to access a DIRECTV
service, the IP address from which a DIRECTV service is accessed, what programming is purchased, streamed or downloaded, and the success status of the last attempted service call by
a DIRECTV Receiver. This information may identify each DIRECTV Receiver registered to your
DIRECTV service account and thus can be associated with your personally identifiable
information. This information can also be associated with your personally identifiable information
if you are logged into your DIRECTV service account while you are using an Authorized Device or
Authorized Application.

Usage information. We may collect certain information about your use of a DIRECTV Receiver,
Authorized Device or Authorized Application, about your viewing choices (such as programming
packages you subscribe to, Pay Per View orders you place, and specific programs you access),
and about your use of DIRECTV programming and services. For example, if you are logged into
your DIRECTV service account while you are visiting our websites or using an Authorized Device
or Authorized Application, this information includes, but is not limited to, which specific pages of
our websites or other Authorized Application you visit or which links you click on, which specific
features of our websites or other Authorized Application you use, which specific programs you
access, and the extent of your viewing of any program or other use of any DIRECTV service.
Similarly, if you connect to a third party social media service (such as Facebook, Twitter or
Viggle) through an icon or link on the DIRECTV program guide or elsewhere within a DIRECTV
service, we will collect the fact that you clicked on the icon or link, the area within the DIRECTV
service you clicked on (such as the program listing on which the icon or link is located), and the
content or other information you posted through that connection. If you use a DIRECTV product
or service that incorporates speech recognition features, we automatically collect audio files and
associated text transcriptions generated from your use of such features. When you access third
party services or use speech recognition features through a DIRECTV Receiver registered to
your DIRECTV service account, or if you are logged into your DIRECTV service account
while you are using an Authorized Device or Authorized Application, such information may be
associated with your personally identifiable information.

Location-based information. If you use an Authorized Application on a device with GPS-based
location features enabled, we may collect and use such information to provide requested location
services and to customize certain programming and service options available to you through the
Authorized Application. If you are not logged into your DIRECTV service account while using
the Authorized Application, this location data does not personally identify you, but it does provide
the real-time geographic location of your device. You can prevent the collection of GPS-based
location information by disabling the GPS functionality on your device. Please be aware that
disabling the GPS functionality on your device may affect the functionality or availability of some
DIRECTV programming and services.

If you use an Authorized Application on a device that does not have GPS- based location
functionality, or such functionality is disabled, we may collect and use your IP address or the local
time reported by the device, or we may require you to enter your ZIP code, to determine your
general location in order to provide customized programming and service options available to you
through the Authorized Application.

Information we collect from third parties. We may collect information about you from third
parties, such as programmers, servicers, commerce and business partners, consumer reporting
agencies, and consumer data companies, and combine it with information we collect from you.

Our use of cookies and other technologies. DIRECTV Receivers, Authorized Devices,
Authorized Applications, and certain other services we offer to our subscribers may use cookies,
e-tokens, tags, web beacons, web bugs, local shared objects (“LSOs,” commonly known as
“Flash cookies”) and other technologies that help us better understand user behavior, tell us
which programs are watched and which features are used, and allow us to control access to
certain DIRECTV programs and services by authenticating a user as a DIRECTV subscriber and
the programming package subscribed to, identifying personal preferences, and identifying
equipment and software configurations as Authorized Devices and Authorized Applications. We also use certain of these technologies to deliver advertisements in our services that relate to
our subscribers' interests and to measure the effectiveness of ad campaigns. Depending on the
DIRECTV Receiver, Authorized Device or Authorized Application, these technologies generally
contain only information concerning the DIRECTV programming and services authorized for
access by such user, personal preferences recorded by such user, and frequently or recently
used features. No personally identifiable information is stored in these technologies.

If you are uncomfortable with these technologies, you may disable them on Authorized Devices or
Authorized Applications, or through your web browsers, where such functionality is capable of
being disabled. Such technologies cannot be disabled on DIRECTV Receivers. Please be aware
that disabling certain of these technologies, such as browser cookies, may affect the functionality
and availability of certain services, such as DIRECTV's personalized online account management
functions and program recommendation features, and may restrict the type of DIRECTV
programming and services (such as DVR Scheduler or video streaming or downloading) that can
be accessed from, performed by, displayed on or linked to through an Authorized Device,
Authorized Application, or third party service. Flash cookies operate differently than browser
cookies and cannot be removed or blocked via web browser settings. To learn more about how to
manage Flash cookies, you can visit the Adobe website (at
http://www.adobe.com/products/flashplayer/articles/ lso/) and make changes at the Global
Privacy Settings Panel (at
http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/
settings_manager02.html).

Links to third party websites and services. When you use DIRECTV products and services,
you will find many opportunities to link to websites of third parties, access services offered by
third parties, or to voluntarily provide personally identifiable information to third parties. When you
click through to these websites, access these services or provide such information, this Policy no
longer applies. We recommend that you read the privacy policy provided by any such third party.</SUBTEXT>

    <SECTION>
        <SUBTITLE>How we use your information.</SUBTITLE>
        <SUBTEXT>We may use the information we collect to deliver our products and services to our subscribers
and to understand what our subscribers want so we can continue to make DIRECTV the best
video and entertainment experience anytime, anywhere. Specifically, we may use the information
for editorial, feedback, marketing and promotion purposes, for statistical research and analysis,
for product and service development and enhancement, for content improvement, for quality
control and troubleshooting purposes, to verify subscriber qualifications to receive our products
and services, to bill for our products and services, to monitor use of our products and services,
and for other legitimate business purposes. We may also use the information to customize
advertising delivered to you via DIRECTV services.

In addition, we may use certain information, such as what programming you have purchased,
streamed or downloaded, to help us recommend viewing choices and personalize your viewing
experience, and help you derive additional benefits from your subscription. We may also use this
information for surveys, audience measurement, and other legitimate business purposes. For
example, if you have DIRECTV DVR service, your DIRECTV Receiver may use your viewing
information to recommend programs for you. Recommendations may also be made based on
programs you record or view through an Authorized Device or an Authorized Application.</SUBTEXT>
    </SECTION>
    <SECTION>
        <SUBTITLE>How we share your information.</SUBTITLE>
        <SUBTEXT>Affiliates. We may share your information with affiliated companies of DIRECTV. If we choose to
share information in this fashion, we will require our affiliates to honor this Policy.

Vendors, suppliers and servicers. We may also share your information with third parties where
it is necessary to conduct a legitimate business activity related to developing, supporting and delivering our products and services and serving our subscribers. For example, we share your
information with servicers that provide bill processing, technical assistance, debt collection,
advertising, service and product analytics, fraud protection, credit risk reduction, and other
support services on our behalf, and also to servicers that provide services through DIRECTV to
our subscribers in order to coordinate delivery or billing, and to deliver advertisements in our
products and services. We take reasonable steps to require these third parties to safeguard
personally identifiable information and require them to adhere to terms consistent with this Policy.

Other companies. We may also share your information with third parties: (1) that own content
and technologies used in our products and services to report on and account for use of such
content and technologies by our subscribers; or (2) with whom we offer co-branded, joint or
customized products or services. We take reasonable steps to require these third parties to
safeguard your personally identifiable information.

Legal or business obligations. We may also share your information with third parties:

• In connection with the sale, transfer, or other assignment of our business, including with
a company that acquires DIRECTV or all or substantially all of our assets. If we are
acquired by another company or if another company acquires some or all of our assets,
that company will possess the personally identifiable information collected by us and will
assume the rights and obligations as described in this Policy;

• When we believe it is appropriate to comply with legal requirements;

• To enforce or apply the DIRECTV Customer Agreement and other
DIRECTV policies and agreements;

• In response to legal process;

• To protect our rights and property, including to combat identity theft, to investigate billing
fraud and to prevent unauthorized reception of DIRECTV programming or services; or

• Where otherwise permitted by law.

In most cases where disclosure is being made pursuant to legal process, we will provide you with
prior notice of the subpoena or court order so that you have the opportunity to contest in a court
proceeding such subpoena or court order.

Commerce partners. Through our products and services we may present promotional offers or
enable you to buy goods and services from us or third party commerce partners. When you elect
to participate in an offer or engage in a transaction with DIRECTV or any such third party, you
may be given to the opportunity to provide, or we, on your behalf, will collect and share with the
third party or its agent, the information required to fulfill your request (such as your name, address
or other contact information, and interest in the offer or transaction). This information is shared
only upon your affirmative response to an offer or transaction. Once such information is shared,
the use of your information will be subject to the third party's privacy policy and this Policy will not
apply.

Social media connections. If you connect to a third party social media service (such as
Facebook, Twitter or Viggle) through an icon or link on the DIRECTV program guide or elsewhere
within a DIRECTV service, we may share the contents of your post and associated information
(such as your user name, your status as a DIRECTV subscriber, and other relevant usage and
diagnostic information) with such third party. This information is shared only when you
affirmatively connect with the third party social media service. Once such information is shared,
the use of your information will be subject to that service's privacy policy and this Policy will not
apply.
Non-personally identifiable information. We may anonymize or aggregate any information we
collect so that the information does not identify you. Our use and disclosure of such anonymized,
aggregated, and other non-personally identifiable information is not subject to any restrictions
under this Policy and we may use it and disclose it to others for any purpose without limitation.</SUBTEXT>
    </SECTION>
    <SECTION>
        <SUBTITLE>Your choices regarding our use of your information.</SUBTITLE>
        <SUBTEXT>Your use of any DIRECTV product or service constitutes your explicit consent to our collection,
use and disclosure of your information, including your personally identifiable information, as
provided in this Policy.
You may request that certain uses and disclosures of your information be restricted as described
below:

Communications from DIRECTV. We may, from time to time, use your information to contact
you by mail, e-mail or telephone to tell you about additional products or services that we or third
parties may offer. If you do not wish to receive such calls or promotional materials from
DIRECTV, call (1-800-531-5000), e-mail (www.directv.com/email) or mail us (DIRECTV Privacy
Policy, P.O. Box 6550, Greenwood Village, CO 80155-6550). If you make these choices, you
understand that we will not be able to inform you about any upcoming features, improvements, or
promotions regarding your DIRECTV service. However, we may still contact you about the
delivery of your DIRECTV service (such as to correct technical issues identified through our
review of diagnostic and statistical information).

Advertisements in our products and services. You may request not to receive advertisements
in our video services selected for you based on your information by calling 1-800-DIRECTV.
However, you may still continue to receive advertisements that are related to the content on a
web page you are visiting or in a service you are using or based on other non-personally
identifiable information. Your request to not receive advertisements applies only to DIRECTV
advertising services and does not affect interest-based advertising from commerce partners with
whom your information has been shared as provided above, or from other parties (such as
advertising networks) that may have access to your information through other services available
on an Authorized Device or Authorized Application.</SUBTEXT>

    <SECTION>
        <SUBTITLE>How long we keep your information.</SUBTITLE>
        <SUBTEXT>We maintain your information as long as necessary for the purpose(s) for which it was collected
or as required by law. When such information is no longer necessary for our business purposes,
we destroy it unless there is an outstanding request or order to preserve it.</SUBTEXT>

    <SECTION>
        <SUBTITLE>How we protect your information.</SUBTITLE>
        <SUBTEXT>We have implemented reasonable administrative, technical, and physical safeguards to protect

    <SECTION>
        <SUBTITLE>How you may access and correct your personally identifiable information.</SUBTITLE>
        <SUBTEXT>The Federal Communications Act, § 338(i) imposes limitations with respect to the collection and
disclosure of personally identifiable information by satellite operators, unless you provide us
consent to collect or disclose information in another fashion. Generally speaking, satellite
operators may not use the satellite system to collect personally identifiable information
concerning subscribers without prior consent of the subscriber concerned except to obtain
information necessary to render our satellite television service or other services to our
subscribers or to detect unauthorized reception of satellite communications. In addition, subject to
certain specified exceptions, satellite operators generally may not disclose personally identifiable information without consent of the subscriber concerned. Also, satellite operators must take such
actions as are necessary to prevent unauthorized access to such information by a person other
than the subscriber or satellite operator. If you believe we have violated the provisions of the
Communications Act, you may bring an action for damages, reasonable attorneys' fees, and
costs. The DIRECTV Customer Agreement contains our agreement that claims such as these
will be resolved by binding arbitration. You received a copy of the Customer Agreement in your
first bill. It is also available at www.directv.com.

You may also obtain access to your personally identifiable information and correct any errors in
such information by contacting us anytime by phone (1-800-531-5000), e-mail
(www.directv.com/email) or mail (DIRECTV Privacy Policy, P.O. Box 6550, Greenwood
Village, CO

        <SUBTEXT>We reserve the right to change this Policy at any time. If we make a material change with regard
to our collection or use of personally identifiable information, we will note on the main page of our
website that this Policy has been updated and may take additional reasonable steps to notify you
about the new or revised policy. In most cases, we will attempt to notify you in some form 30 days
before the effective date of the change. To comment on or ask about this Policy, call (1-800-531-
