        <SUBTITLE>Our Privacy Commitment</SUBTITLE>
        <SUBTEXT>At Future Shop we know how important it is to protect your personal information. Whether you are shopping with us online or in person we want to make every customer experience safe and secure. In keeping with that goal, we have developed this Privacy Policy to explain our practices for the collection, use, and disclosure of your personal information.

This Policy applies to our retail stores, our Web Sites, and all other channels in which Future Shop collects and uses your personal information.

        <SUBTITLE>What Information does Future Shop Collect?</SUBTITLE>
        <SUBTEXT>At Future Shop, we collect two types of information: personal information and non-personal information. The types of information we collect depend on the nature of your interaction with us.

Personal information
Personal information is information that can identify an individual or information about an identifiable individual. We may collect personal information such as:

your contact information - e.g., name, postal address, telephone number, and email address;
your personal preferences - e.g., product wish lists, language preferences, and marketing consent; and
your transaction information - e.g., products purchased, method of payment, amount paid, and credit or debit card number.
Non-personal information
Non-personal information does not identify you as an individual. For example:

we may ask you for your postal code to assist us with planning our flyer distribution;
we may collect certain non-personal data when you visit our Web Sites, such as the type of browser you are using or the referring URL; or
we may collect and summarize customer information in a non-personal, aggregate format for statistical and research purposes. We may, for example, summarize our data to determine that a certain percentage of contest entrants are male, aged 18 to 25.
All references to "Web Sites" in this Privacy Policy mean www.futureshop.ca or other Future Shop provided Web sites.

You may choose not to provide us with your personal information. However, if you make this choice we may not be able to provide you with the product, service, or information that you requested. For example, we can only offer you a Future Shop credit card if you have provided us with certain financial information.

        <SUBTITLE>Your Consent</SUBTITLE>
        <SUBTEXT>Future Shop will collect, use, or disclose your personal information only with your knowledge and consent, except where required or permitted by law. When you choose to provide us with your personal information you consent to the use of your personal information as identified in this Privacy Policy and as may be further identified at the time of collection.

        <SUBTITLE>Information Future Shop Collects Directly from You</SUBTITLE>
        <SUBTEXT>Listed here are some further examples of the ways that we collect personal information directly from you and how we use it.

In-Store Purchases
When you purchase a Future Shop product or service, you may need to provide us with contact and payment information (such as credit card information) so that we can process your request or complete your transaction. Examples where we need contact information include delivery services, product servicing, in-home installations, and extended warranty coverage.

Returns and Exchanges
Our goal is to ensure that you are completely satisfied with your purchase and to this end, Future Shop offers a Return Policy. For Future Shop to continue to offer our Return Policy, we ask for personal information such as your name, address, and telephone number for the purposes of detecting and preventing fraud and error, or to communicate with you regarding your return or exchange, if necessary. You may also be asked to produce photo ID for verification purposes only.

Applying for the Future Shop Credit Card
When you apply for a Future Shop credit card, certain contact and financial information is collected and reviewed by our credit card provider, JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. ("Chase"), to approve, establish and maintain credit card accounts. Chase has its own privacy policy, available here, which governs its relationship with you. We also encourage you to read their privacy statement provided with your credit card application.

ReClaim Insurance Replacement
When working with our ReClaim Consultants to replace goods that are covered under your insurance policy, we will need some basic information, such as your contact information, insurance claim number, and the name of your claim adjuster, so we can process your quote in a timely manner and bill your insurance company directly for you.

Purchase Follow-Up and Surveys
Following a purchase from some of our departments we may send you a follow-up letter to thank you for your business, or we may contact you to ensure that you are completely satisfied with the delivery, setup, or installation of your new product.

We may use contact information collected in-store, online, or via our call centres to conduct occasional surveys and other customer research. These surveys are entirely voluntary and you may easily decline to participate.

Our Web Sites
Our Web Sites can be browsed anonymously. However, to engage in certain special features or functions of our Web Sites, or to order products and services from our Web Sites, you may be asked to provide certain personal information, such as your name, email address, postal address, telephone number, or credit card information. We use this information to create your account, contact and correspond with you about your order, respond to your inquiries, and monitor functions of our Web Sites that you choose to use, such as online forums.

If you choose to ship an order to a third party, you represent and warrant that you have obtained all necessary consents from the third party to permit Future Shop to collect, use, and disclose the third party's personal information for the purposes of fraud prevention and processing and shipping the order.

Online Forums and Customer Reviews
Certain pages of our Web Sites, such as "Community Forum", facilitate interactive discussions between users and Future Shop staff or agents acting on our behalf regarding products and services available for purchase through the Web Sites. The Customer Review functionality is provided as a rating system that offers you the chance to share your thoughts on a product. These public forums and reviews are accessible to all Web Site visitors so please use discretion when posting information to them and do not post personal information.

Sign-Up for Newsletters or Updates
Future Shop offers a variety of newsletters and promotional communications.  You may choose to stop receiving these communications at any time.  Each marketing or promotional email we send to you will include a link or other method to quickly and easily unsubscribe and decline further similar emails. You may also use the unsubscribe link included below under the heading "Unsubscribe.”  Our subscriber list is never sold or rented to other parties.

Participate in a Contest or Promotion
From time to time, we may run contests or promotions. If you participate, you may be asked for contact information as well as additional optional survey information (for example, product preferences). Personal information from contest entries will be used only to administer the contest and contact you if you win. For research and analysis purposes, we may also summarize contest survey information in a manner that no longer identifies individual participants. All contests and promotions are subject to this Privacy Policy and the rules that will be available with each particular campaign. Some contests are conducted by third parties and will be subject to the third party's policies.

Email a Friend
While visiting our Web Sites you may choose to use the "Email a Friend" tool which allows you to inform a friend about products of interest to you. The information you provide will be used to send a one-time email to your friend, inviting them to our Web Sites. We will not add your friend to a mailing list and will not send them further email unless they choose to receive such communications from us. When using the "Email a Friend" tool you are contacting your friend directly and as such you acknowledge that you are responsible for this correspondence and not Future Shop. If you provide us with personal information concerning another individual (e.g., email address), you represent and warrant that you have obtained all necessary consents from that individual to enable us to use that personal information for the identified purpose.

Subscription Services and Activations
Future Shop may offer activation of certain products and services like cellular plans, satellite services, or Internet services. These activations may require that certain contact and financial information be collected and provided to the respective service providers as part of the activation process. For example, a cellular carrier may need to perform a credit check prior to activation so a government-issued ID number and your credit card number may be provided to the carrier for that purpose.

Call Centres
Future Shop operates customer support call centres to accept and address your questions, concerns, or complaints. When you contact our call centres, we may ask for personal information to help us respond to your inquiry or to verify your identity. For example if you have a question about the status of a recent online order, we will ask for personal information to verify that you are the account holder. We may also monitor or record your telephone discussions with our customer support representatives for training purposes and to ensure service quality.

We may then provide these reports to advertisers and others. None of the tracking information in these reports can be connected to the identities or other personal information of individual users. For our own research purposes we may link tracking information with personal information voluntarily provided by Web Site users. Once such a link is made, all of the linked information is treated as personal information and will be used and disclosed only in accordance with this Privacy Policy.

Links to Other Web Sites
Our Web Site may contain links to other Web sites or Internet resources which are provided solely for your convenience and information. When you click on one of those links you are contacting another Web site or Internet resource.

Service Providers
Future Shop may use third parties to manage one of more aspects of our business operations, including the processing or handing of personal information.

Product Safety Recalls
In the event we receive notice from a manufacturer of a product safety recall, we may provide your contact information, limited to name, address, and telephone number, to the manufacturer so that they may notify you of the recall and supply details of any replacement or repair programs. This transfer or your contact information will occur only for recalls that may impact your personal safety or impair the functionality of the product you purchased from us.

Sale or Transfer of all or part of Future Shop
Any information we have about you may be transferred or disclosed to a purchaser or prospective purchaser in the event of a sale, assignment, or other transfer of all or a portion of our business or assets. Should such a transfer occur, we will use reasonable efforts to try to ensure that the transferee uses your information in a manner that is consistent with this Privacy Policy.

Legal Disclosure
Future Shop may disclose your information as permitted or required by law. For example, we may be compelled to release information by a court of law or other person or entity with jurisdiction to compel production of such information. If we have reasonable grounds to believe information could be useful in the investigation of improper or unlawful activity, we may disclose information to law enforcement agencies or other appropriate investigative bodies.
