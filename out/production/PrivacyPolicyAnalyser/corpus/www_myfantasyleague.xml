        <SUBTITLE>The Way We Use Information</SUBTITLE>
        <SUBTEXT>We use the information you provide about yourself when placing an order only to complete that order. We do not share this information with outside parties except to the extent necessary to complete that order.

We do not, in any manner, use the information voluntarily entered on your league page. It is important to realize that anyone (not just your league members) may view your personal (non-MFL) web site if defined, but the contact information you enter on your league page is only seen by league members while they are logged in.

We use return email addresses to answer the email we receive. Such addresses are not used for any other purpose and are not shared with outside parties.

Finally, we never use or share the personally identifiable information provided to us online in ways unrelated to the ones described above without also providing you an opportunity to opt-out or otherwise prohibit such unrelated uses.</SUBTEXT>
