Cookies
We use cookies to collect information and help personalize your user experience. We store minimal personally identifying information in cookies and protect this information.

Most web browsers automatically accept cookies. Browsers can be configured to prevent this, but if you do not accept any cookies from www.nejm.org, you will not be able to use the site. The site will function if you block third party cookies.
In some cases we also work with third party vendors (such as Google) to help deliver advertisements on our behalf across the Internet. These vendors may use cookies to collect information about your activity at our site (i.e., the pages you have visited) in order to help deliver particular ads that they believe you would find most relevant. You can opt out of those vendors' use of cookies to tailor advertising to you by visiting http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp.
Clear Gifs (Web Beacons/Web Bugs)
We may also use clear gifs which are tiny graphics with unique identifiers that function similarly to cookies to help us to track site activity. We do not use these to collect personally identifying information.
