        <SUBTITLE>What types of information does IKEA collect and use about me and how does IKEA use the information?</SUBTITLE>
        <SUBTEXT>We collect and use information about you to communicate with you about our products, services and promotions. We also collect information to improve the shopping experience of IKEA consumers. Here are the ways we obtain information about you and the types of information we obtain. We also tell you how we use the information.

Catalog
When you request a catalog from us, you provide us with contact information, such as your name, address, phone number and email address, so we may fulfill your request.

Email
When you subscribe to our email list, you provide us information such as your email address, name and ZIP code so we may communicate with you via email. We will send you email only if you have provided us with your email address and have asked us to communicate with you this way. To update your email communication preferences, or to unsubscribe, please click here.

Purchases
When you order or purchase an IKEA product, you may be required to give us contact and payment information (such as credit card information) so we may process your order. When you pay for an IKEA product using a credit card, we use your credit card information only to fulfil your order and for other internal purposes.

Purchase verification policy
Please note that IKEA may request to verify your purchases against your receipt. Please keep your receipt available to show an IKEA representative upon request.

IKEA FAMILY
If you sign up for IKEA FAMILY, you will be asked for your name, date of birth (to confirm eligibility) and information about how you wish to be contacted, such as email address, mobile phone number and home address.

Customer Service
If you contact one of our customer service representatives, we may ask you for information such as your name, address and email address so we can respond to your questions or comments. With your consent, we may retain this information to personalize your experience with us and better assist you the next time you contact us.

Help Us to Improve (HUTI)
In store we provide you with the option to leave a personal comment to the store manager. During this process you have the option to provide us with such information as your name, address, email address and telephone number so that we can respond to your questions or concerns. The information that is collected and retained by this unit is for IKEA's use only.

Customer Profiles
On our website and in store we provide you with the option to create a customer profile. The profile allows you to save shopping lists that you create in your in store and online visits, as well as allowing you to save personal planners and designs on the IKEA server and quickly access them when you are in the store. The customer profile includes personal information such as your name and address, your telephone number and your email address. The customer profile allows us to facilitate your IKEA shopping experience and to expedite the delivery of purchased products. The IKEA customer profile is optional.

Website
We collect information on our website using transient cookies, sometimes called session cookies. A transient cookie is a small file that contains information about a user, and disappears when the user's browser is closed. Unlike a persistent cookie, a transient cookie is not stored on the user's hard drive; it is stored only in temporary memory that is erased when the web browser is closed. We use transient cookies to determine, for example, how you use our website so we can improve the design of our site. Transient cookies are not linked to any personally identifiable information about you. Cookies can be disabled in your web browser.

When you visit our web site, we also collect anonymous information from you. This includes the Internet browser you are using; the computer operating system you are using, time spent visiting the web site, usage patterns within the web site, and the domain name of the web site from which you linked to our site. This information is not matched to your personal information and does not personally identify you. We collect this information to help improve your experience on the web site. Additionally, IKEA may share account or other information when we believe it is necessary to comply with the law or protect our interests and property. This may include sharing information with other companies, lawyers or government agencies in connection with issues related to fraud or government subpoenas and warrants.

Mobile
IKEA offers our customers the ability to find out what's new at their local IKEA store through their mobile device, either by browsing our mobile web site or through text messaging. Usage of the mobile web site follows similar standards employed by our standard web site; cookies may be employed to remember preferences or previous activity but do not reveal personal information and can be disabled using your mobile device's Internet options. For text messaging, users will only receive messages if they have specifically opted in for them; standard text message rates will apply. To join IKEA Mobile, text the keyword "JOIN" to 62345. To unsubscribe from IKEA Mobile, text the keyword "STOP" to 62345.

Kid's Ballroom
To take advantage of our supervised children's play area and ballroom while you shop, we require you to fill out a registration card that asks for the child's name and age, the parent's or guardian's name, address, telephone number and signature, and any health concerns relating to the child that we should know. We ask for this information to help ensure the safety and security of the child.

Other information you provide to us
Through surveys, you may provide us with information such as product preferences, reasons for purchasing a product, family and lifestyle information to help us learn more about your shopping preferences. You also may provide such information when you fill out a warranty card about a product you purchased from IKEA. In addition, you may give us such information if you register for or redeem IKEA special offers, discount coupons or other promotions.

We also may ask you to provide us with information about products that interest you and other lifestyle information. We will use such information to learn about your needs and preferences and if you choose to receive further communications from IKEA, to provide you with information about our products services and promotions.</SUBTEXT>

Other times we may obtain your consent implicitly by asking you to provide information with stated purposes but without any express statement of consent (such as when you order a product or request a catalogue). In other cases, your consent may be implied such as when you respond to a survey when it is understood that we will use the information to learn more about your needs and preferences, or your satisfaction as a customer so as to improve our products and services. In those cases your consent will be understood if you provide us with the requested information. You may notify us at any time that you do not wish us to use your information for any purposes that are not required to complete a transaction by contacting us in any of the ways described at the end of this Notice. You may at any time withdraw or change your consent to our use and disclosure of your information or request us to delete if from our files, subject to legal and contractual restrictions and requirements related to any transaction.</SUBTEXT>
