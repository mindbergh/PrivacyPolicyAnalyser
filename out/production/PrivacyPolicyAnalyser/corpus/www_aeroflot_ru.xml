        <SUBTITLE>OUR PLEDGE TO YOUR PRIVACY</SUBTITLE>
        <SUBTEXT>Sabre, Inc. is a travel and transportation technology company that licenses Internet Booking Engines (""IBEs"") to travel resellers. Sabre understands and appreciates the fact that protecting your privacy is very important to you. That's why we have written this document, detailing our commitment to your privacy. Sabre understands and appreciates the fact that protecting your privacy is very important to you. That's why we have written this document, detailing Sabre's commitment to your privacy. First and foremost, in accordance with our corporate policy, Sabre pledges that it will not release, sell, or trade your personal information without your consent. You will have choices as to how your personal information is used by Sabre. An exception must be made when court orders, government agencies or law enforcement authorities require us to release information according to federal and state laws, or in the unlikely event of a sale of the business or transfer of assets.

When you complete the Member Profile form for this Sabre IBE product web site, the information you provide is used by Sabre to, among other things, reduce the effort required for you to search for and book travel on this web site. This IBE will likely be improved over time. Future versions will enable us to tailor our display of the relevant travel options and information shown to you based on information you provide.

The travel arrangers who license certain versions of IBEs from Sabre can choose an option that allows them to download your Member Profile information for their own use. The travel arranger utilizing this IBE may or may not have chosen that option. To the extent applicable, be aware that with this option the downloaded information (including changes you make to the Member Profile) is updated on a regular basis by Sabre but it may take up to a week for the updated information to be reflected in the travel arranger's database. Sabre requests that travel arrangers use Member Profile data in accordance with your stated wishes, but there is no obligation on the travel arranger to follow Sabre's privacy policies once the Member Profile information is in your travel arranger's possession. Consequently, you should familiarize yourself with the privacy policies of your travel arranger before completing the Member Profile form or using this web site. Sabre hereby disclaims any and all liability for the actions of our travel arranger with respect to the use of your data and any related data privacy issues.

At times, Sabre provides information to the companies that participate in its IBE web site, e.g., companies that provide banner advertising and to the travel providers participating in your itinerary. In the case of the former, the information is only aggregate data that does not contain any personal information about you. In the case of the latter, only the personal information you provided required to confirm your travel arrangements or other information you have given us permission to share is provided. As stated in this document, our policies and procedures are designed with a goal to prevent anyone other than Sabre and your travel arranger from having access to your personal information.

As stated more fully below, you will have the option to choose whether or not you wish to receive or continue to receive information about special offers from Sabre. Information about special offers, etc. from your travel arranger is subject to the policies of your travel arranger. Further, this policy does not constitute a contract. By use of the IBE you acknowledge that you do not intend this privacy policy to form a contract.</SUBTEXT>

        <SUBTITLE>HOW INFORMATION IS GATHERED</SUBTITLE>
        <SUBTEXT>Voluntary Information

Any information that you give us is stored in a secure database. Sabre requires only that you create a user name and password to access the IBE, as a means of limiting your travel reseller's exposure to robotic search engines that drive up his/her cost of serving you. Your travel reseller may optionally require that you input more information as a condition of accessing the licensed IBE. Only input fields flagged with an asterisk (*) require information be provided, all others are optional. You may choose not to input information into those fields but you will need to input this information again each time you create a travel booking. When you are logged in as a registered user, we track the travel options you search in order to learn more about your travel preferences. If you have authorized such use, the licensing travel reseller may advise you of special travel deals geared towards your preferences. In future generations of the IBEs, we will use your preferences and historical site behavior to display travel content and banner ads specifically targeted towards your needs. We want to make your experience with Sabre IBEs as relevant and productive as possible, to encourage your loyalty.
Automatic Information

Cookies: When you prepare to log-on to this Sabre IBE our server can automatically recognize your personal computer by your encrypted Member Key that is also known as a ""cookie."" Although this Member Key allows us to identify you when you return, our security standards require that you enter your username and password every single time you visit us. This enhances security and also allows us to tailor your visit to our site with special discounts or offers that are most relevant to your needs.

Eventually, Sabre will also record the ""click stream"" data generated when you log into the IBE. Capturing this information will allow Sabre to automatically customize your Sabre IBE experience by knowing what parts of the IBE you click on most often, how you arrived at the IBE, which browser you use, etc. Other items to be tracked automatically will eventually include the Internet Service Provider you use, the domain you visited previously, and the URL that the browser accessed. When Sabre begins using click stream data, it will help us to set up the IBE for your usage preferences, ensure that we design our IBEs to be compatible with your equipment and recommend partnership candidates to travel arrangers who hope to attract and keep your business. Sabre does not yet store IBE click stream data on an individual-user basis or use it for any of the above-described purposes. Sabre does, however, use individual users' click steam information in an anonymous form to reflect group interests. This helps us modify our site to make it more useful to the largest number of people. Your Member Profile information may be viewed and edited by logging in to the IBE and selecting ""Update Profile"" from the Main Menu page. When Sabre begins storing personally identifiable click stream information on individual users' we will provide reasonable access for you to view it as well.

Go to the ""Help"" utilities on your web browser to (1) find information about the ability to warn you when new cookies are received, (2) learn how to prevent the acceptance of new cookies, or (3) learn how to disable cookies altogether. Please remember that allowing your computer to receive and store cookies will give you the full benefit of the Sabre IBE and can enhance overall performance during your web site visit. The choice, of course, is yours to make.</SUBTEXT>

        <SUBTITLE>HOW YOUR INFORMATION IS USED</SUBTITLE>
        <SUBTEXT>Sabre takes its pledge to protect your privacy seriously. It is your choice as to whether your personal information will be released to a third party by Sabre, except for the situation when we have to initiate, supplement or verify the data necessary to complete transactions that you have requested or purchased. Your travel arranger will follow its own policies with respect to the release of your personal information to third parties.

As an example, you may ask Sabre to provide your name and address to a merchant or travel provider so that they can complete an order or other request for you. Sabre we will furnish that vendor with the appropriate information in order for them to fulfill your request. Another way information is provided to travel providers and merchants is when we sort information based on group statistics. For example, we may advise a merchant that there are 20,000 IBE users interested in receiving information about theater tickets in New York. The sharing of this type of information will not be linked to any individual traveler.</SUBTEXT>

        <SUBTITLE>HOW WE USE THIRD PARTIES</SUBTITLE>
        <SUBTEXT>A third party may be used to fulfill delivery of travel offers from Sabre. For example, we may engage a third party (such as an email service company) to provide you with the details of a special weekend rate for a hotel in Paris if you have told us that you are interested in European travel. When a third party vendor is used for this purpose they agree to maintain the confidentiality of your personal data in accord with the same conditions as outlined in the provisions of the policy you see here.</SUBTEXT>

        <SUBTITLE>RECEIVING SPECIAL OFFERS</SUBTITLE>
        <SUBTEXT>Sabre will use your e-mail address to send confirmations and other travel-related e-mail messages related to your specific use of this IBE as well as for administrative items such as forgotten password messages. If you opt-out in your Member Profile, Sabre will not directly solicit you with travel offers through this IBE. Your travel arranger, however, may choose to do so and Sabre has no control over those actions. As noted earlier, if you have opted out of such offers in your Member Profile, Sabre will request that the travel arranger respect your wishes, but does not directly enforce their compliance.</SUBTEXT>
