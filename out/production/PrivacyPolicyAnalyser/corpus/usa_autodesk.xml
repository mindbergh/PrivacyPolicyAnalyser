        <SUBTITLE>What this privacy statement covers</SUBTITLE>
        <SUBTEXT>This privacy statement tells you about our privacy practices for our websites, products, online and web services, and apps that include a link or reference to this statement. It also tells you about our marketing and advertising practices, and applies to our offline practices. In this statement we will refer to our products, online and web services and apps as “applications.”

Some of our websites and applications may display supplemental privacy or data collection notices that we share so you can make informed choices about what you want to do when you review the notices. For example, you may see a notice explaining data collection practices for an application, and your choices for participating. In special cases, websites and applications may have their own privacy policies. For example, we may buy another company to expand our business, and need some time to integrate the company's privacy practices with ours.

Third parties (such as social media platforms or other company websites that we link to from our websites and applications) are responsible for their own privacy practices. Be sure to read the privacy policies, supplemental notices, and settings of all websites or platforms that you visit so you can understand their privacy practices and your options.

Some websites and applications are subject to additional terms such as our website terms of use, terms of service, and software license agreements. Please read the terms that apply to the website or application you are using. These terms can help answer questions you may have about the confidentiality and security of designs and other content you create, and the effect of sharing and posting of content by you.

        <SUBTITLE>Information we collect about you</SUBTITLE>
        <SUBTEXT>User IDs, registration, and contact

We collect information that identifies you when you

register to use one of our websites or applications
register to attend an event
create a user ID to access our websites or applications
contact us for services, support, information or other reasons

We may collect your name, company name, email address and other contact information, a profile image (which may be a picture of you), or payment information.  Sometimes we collect other information that does not identify you, like your job title, industry or interests.  Some information is required, and other information is optional.

For student and education versions of our applications, we may require information to confirm your eligibility.  For our customers who make purchases through our channel partners or ecommerce providers, we will receive personal information about you from these companies so that we can have an accurate record of applications to which you have access.

To help keep our databases current and to provide you with more relevant content, experiences and offerings, we may combine information you give us with information from public sources and trustworthy companies (such as our resellers and ecommerce providers, and business contact databases), all in accordance with applicable law.

For example, these sources can tell us about the company size and industry of our business customers, and also help us maintain the accuracy of our databases.

Autodesk desktop product activation and automatic updates
When you activate an Autodesk desktop application, we collect information about your system, the desktop application you are activating, and the application (product) serial number. Learn more about activation. Some of our applications include features that connect to our servers and let you install updates to the application. We may keep track of information such as whether the update was successful or not.

Websites and applications
Our websites or applications may collect usage information so we can manage our agreement with you or the company, organization or institution through which you receive access – for example, so we know how much to charge based on amount of use, or when the limit of the services paid for has been reached. You can get more information by reading the terms of service or software license agreement that applies to the applications you are using, and by talking to your license or contract administrator.

Some of our websites and applications include specific data collection programs. Depending on the website or application, this information may or may not be associated with your personal information. You can learn more about specific programs, as well as your choices about how we use this information.

Automatic data collection tools, cookies and similar technologies
When you communicate with us, access our websites and applications through a browser, application, or other client, our servers automatically collect and record certain information. For example, your browser or device may tell us your browser type, language preference and the Internet Protocol (IP) address (which may tell us generally where you are located) and the type of device or system you used. Your browser may also tell us information such as the time and date of your request, page that led you to our website and, if applicable, the search terms you typed into a search engine that led you to our website.

In addition, we and our service providers may use cookies and similar technologies to collect information about how you use our websites and applications, and to measure the success of email or advertising campaigns. Choices about cookies and similar technologies.

When we send you emails, they might include a web beacon or similar technology that lets us know if you received or opened the email and whether you clicked on any of the links in the email. You can opt-out of marketing emails.

Buttons, tools, ads, and content from other companies
Our websites and applications may include buttons, tools, advertisements, or content that links to another companies' services (for example, a Facebook "Like" button on a webpage, a Google Maps feature in an application, or an ad in a mobile app). We may collect information about your use of these features.

In addition, when you see or interact with these buttons, tools, ads, or content, or view our webpage or application containing them, some information from your browser may automatically be sent to the other company. Please read that company's privacy policy for more information. You can also learn more about application usage metrics, cookies and your advertising choices.

Advertising
Our websites and applications may feature ads for other companies' products and services, as well as for ads our own applications.

We may work with one or more advertising networks (each an Ad Partner) who use cookies, tracking pixels, or other technologies to collect information in order to serve you ads and help us track results. Examples of this information may include, but are not limited to, websites you visit, mobile apps you use, preferences you may provide us as the app provider (such as language preferences), your IP address (for purposes of determining your general location), device ID, MAC address, and browser information. This information helps:

ensure that appropriate advertising is shown in the application or on the website
calculate and control the number of unique and repeat views of a given ad
deliver ads that relate to your interests, and
measure the effectiveness of ad campaigns

Some technology enables advertising to be temporarily uploaded onto your mobile device and replaced while you are online.

We do not actively share personal information with our Ad Partners or third party advertisers for their direct marketing purposes unless you give us your consent. Our Ad Partners deliver ads for us and may combine the information collected or obtained from us with other information they have independently collected from other websites and/or other online or mobile products and services relating to your browser's activities across their network of websites.

Please note that if you choose to click on an ad or participate in promotions of any third-party advertisers via an ad that appears in our application, this is solely between you and the advertiser and your participation is subject to the terms and conditions associated with that ad or promotion.

Your choices about ads.

Social sign on and social networking
Some of our websites and applications may allow you to sign in using a social networking platform account (such as Facebook, Google+ or Twitter). Social sign-on features may make creating an account with us faster for you by pre-populating our registration or user profile form with information you provided to the social networking platform. The first time you use a social sign-on service, the social media platform typically explains what information will be shared with us.

Also, we have pages on many social networking platforms where you can visit and communicate with us. We may collect information when you visit our social networking pages. We will use this and social sign-on information for the purposes described in this privacy statement. Be sure to review the privacy and data usage policies of any social networking platform you use to learn more about its personal information practices and your options.

Children
Some Autodesk websites and applications are intended for general audiences. However, we do not knowingly collect any personal information from children aged 12 years old and under. In some jurisdictions, notification, prior written permission or other verifiable parental consent may be required of a parent or guardian for children from 13 to 17 years of age. No information should be submitted nor posted to Autodesk websites or applications by children 12 years old or under.

        <SUBTITLE>Information and content that you disclose</SUBTITLE>
        <SUBTEXT>Some of our websites and applications allow you to post “likes,” comments, profile information (including profile images), videos, photographs, images, design files, and other content for others to see. In some cases you can limit who can view or access information and content you post. In other cases, the information and content might be available to registered members of the application or website, or even to the general public.

We urge you to be careful and thoughtful when deciding to disclose personal information, or any other information, on our applications and websites. If you are posting information you to not want to be disclosed publicly, make sure you are using a website or application that allows you to control who sees information you have posted.

Please note that in some of our application and website forums, your name, user name, profile image, or email address may be posted along with any message you post. For example, information posted on Area, Instructables and Socialcam will be public by default. If you choose to share personal information in this way, the access limitations, security protocols and other commitments in this privacy statement will not apply to the information shared.

For information about how to access or remove personal information or content you share, read the information access, controls and choices section.

For some websites or applications, we may allow access to certain content that you have shared publicly, including personal information, through an application programming interface (API). Learn more.

You can say no to a specific introduction, and you can also ask not to receive requests for introductions in the future.

Application programming interfaces
We may allow access to certain content, including personal information, posted through websites or applications through an application programming interface (API).

API access will be mentioned in the applicable terms of service. We place limitations on what third party developers can do with information. Below is information about your choices.

Public information access by third-party applications

On some websites and applications, content you post is public and cannot be marked as non-public or private. Check the posting controls for the specific application or website you are using.

Where there is an option to mark content as private or otherwise choose a non-public status, and you choose the non-public option, third party developers will not be able to access the following information through a public information access API:

the content (including its title, and public comments you include with the content);
the name (or pseudonym) associated with your account;
the profile image associated with you;
the profile URL (which may include user ID) for the account.

If your content is “public” but you do not want developers to have access to your real name or profile image (for example, if it is a picture of your face), use a pseudonym or “handle” and use a profile image that does not consist of a picture of you.

Authenticated access by applications

You may choose to use third party applications that manage your interactions with our websites or applications. For example, third party applications may want to do the following types of activities:

Manage relationships: to manage user relationships on your behalf, such as follow, unfollow, block, and unblock people, and to approve people who want to follow you on our website or application;
Manage content: to post and remove content on your behalf;
Manage likes: to manage likes and similar actions on your behalf; and
Manage comments: to manage and post comments on your behalf.

We require the app developers to explain what actions they will take and also what information (including personal information) they need to access in order to take these actions, and to get your approval. In addition, we require developers to provide a link to an explanation of their privacy practices.

It is your choice to approve or not approve access by these third party applications.

Limitations on access by third party applications

In both cases described above, third party application developers are not allowed to use your personal information for marketing or promotional purposes without your consent, and are otherwise restricted in their use of your information by the terms of the applicable App Developer Agreement.

You can find links to the applicable App Developer Agreement through the applicable terms of service. For convenient reference, here is a non-exclusive list of the current agreements:

Cookies and similar technologies
Autodesk and our service providers may use “cookies,” "pixel tags," "web beacons," "clear GIFs," or other similar technologies in connection with website pages and HTML-formatted e-mail messages to, among other things, track the actions of website users and e-mail recipients, determine the success of marketing campaigns, compile aggregate statistics about website usage and response rates and make it easier for you to navigate our website or better tailor your experience with us, for example by not requiring you to submit login credentials repeatedly or by showing you content targeted to your interests.

A “cookie” is a commonly used automated data collection tool.  A cookie is a small amount of data that is sent to a browser from a web server and gets saved on the hard drive of the computer that you are using.  Cookies and similar tools collect standard information from your browser such as browser type, browser language, and the website address you came from when you visited our website.

If you do not want information collected through the use of cookies, there is a simple procedure in most browsers that allows you to automatically decline cookies, or to be given the choice of declining or accepting the transfer of a particular cookie, or cookies from a particular web site, to your computer.

If you set your browser to reject all cookies, you will be unable to use our websites and applications that require registration or customization in order to participate. If you choose to accept cookies from us and our service providers, you are granting us and our service providers your consent to set cookies on your computer. To learn more about cookies and other automatic data collection tools, please visit www.allaboutcookies.org.

When we send you emails, they might include a web beacon or similar technology that lets us know if you received or opened the email and whether you clicked on any of the links in the email. You can opt-out of marketing emails.

You must choose to send us the report. Learn more about CER.
