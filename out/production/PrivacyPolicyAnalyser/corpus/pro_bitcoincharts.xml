        <SUBTITLE>Privacy Policy</SUBTITLE>
        <SUBTEXT>When you register with the site, you will be asked to provide certain personal information, including your email address. We will store your personal information, but will not share it with any third parties, except as necessary to provide the services offered, to monitor usage, and to improve the service. For example, we may store your personal information along with your files and data on a third party server such as Amazon Web Services; or we may use a third party analytics tool like Google Analytics to learn how you are using our services, and how we can improve that experience. We also use your personal information to send you notifications about the service and to respond to customer support requests. We will never share your personal information with advertisers or send you promotions for unrelated services. You can cancel your account by logging in to your account settings page.

We may be required to disclose your personal information in order to:

comply with the law or legal process;
protect or defend our rights or property, or the rights or property of others;
enforce these terms; or
respond to claims that the content of any material on our system violates the rights of others.
If we must disclose your personal information in order to comply with the law or legal process, we will inform you (at the email address you provide) as soon as practicable, provided that it is lawful for us to do so.

We will also aggregate user information and perform statistical analyses of the collective behavior of our members and visitors, to measure overall demographics, and to analyze how to improve our service. We may share this information with third parties (such as Google Analytics), but such aggregate information does not contain personal information other than IP addresses. In addition, we may compile and disclose aggregate information about our users for promotional or other purposes. For example, we might want to disclose that a certain percentage of our users are located within a particular geographic area or log on most frequently in the mornings.

We use session and login cookies, which help us keep track of when a person is logged in and which services people use. We will also capture login timestamps, and usage statistics, as well as IP addresses.

We will communicate with you via email, to the email address you provide to us. Some communications, such as emails informing you of new features, may be unsubscribed to via the unsubscribe link in the email. If you would like to cease all communications from us, please contact us via the email address provided in the Contact section below.</SUBTEXT>

        <SUBTEXT>These terms shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the state of Colorado, without giving effect to its conflict of law provisions. You agree that you will bring any claim or cause of action arising out of your use of the site in the courts located within Denver County, and you also agree to submit to the personal and exclusive jurisdiction of those courts. You agree that any claim or cause of action arising out of your use of the site or these terms must be filed within 90 days after such claim or cause of action arose or it shall be forever barred, notwithstanding any statute of limitations or other law to the contrary.
