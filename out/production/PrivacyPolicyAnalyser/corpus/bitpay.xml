        <SUBTITLE>How we use cookies</SUBTITLE>
        <SUBTEXT>When you access our website, we, or companies we hire to track how our website is used, may place small data files called "cookies" on your computer. We and our service providers also use cookies to customize the BitPay Services, content and advertising; measure promotional effectiveness, and promote trust and safety.

We send a "session cookie" to your computer when you log in to your account or otherwise use the BitPay Services. This type of cookie helps us to recognize you if you visit multiple pages on our site during the same session, so that we don not need to ask you for your password on each page. Once you log out or close your browser, this cookie expires and no longer has any effect.

We also use longer-lasting cookies for other purposes such as to display your e-mail address on our sign-in form, so that you don't need to retype the e-mail address each time you log in to your account.

We encode our cookies so that only we can interpret the information stored in them. You are free to decline our cookies if your browser permits, but doing so may interfere with your use of our website. We may also collect information about your computer or other access device to mitigate risk and for fraud prevention purposes.

You may encounter cookies from third parties when using the BitPay Services on websites that we do not control (for example, if you view a web page created by a third party or use an application developed by a third party, there may be a cookie placed by that web page or application.)</SUBTEXT>

        <SUBTITLE>How we protect and store personal information</SUBTITLE>
        <SUBTEXT>Throughout this policy, we use the term "personal information" to describe information that can be associated with a specific person and can be used to identify that person. We do not consider personal information to include information that has been anonymized so that it does not identify a specific user.

We store and process your personal information on our computers in the US and elsewhere in the world where BitPay facilities are located, and we protect it by maintaining physical, electronic and procedural safeguards in compliance with applicable US federal and state regulations. We use computer safeguards such as firewalls and data encryption, we enforce physical access controls to our buildings and files, and we authorize access to personal information only for those employees who require it to fulfill their job responsibilities.</SUBTEXT>

        <SUBTEXT>We do not sell or rent your personal information to third parties for their marketing purposes without your explicit consent. We may combine your information with information we collect from other companies and use it to improve and personalize the BitPay Services, content and advertising.

How we share personal information with other BitPay users

To process your payments, we may share some of your personal information with the person or company that you are paying or that is paying you. Your contact information, date of sign-up, the number of payments you have received from verified BitPay users, and whether you have verified control of a bank account are provided to other BitPay users who you transact with through BitPay. In addition, this and other information may also be shared with third parties when you use these third parties to access the BitPay Services. Unless you have agreed to it, these third parties are not allowed to use this information for any purpose other than to enable the BitPay Services.

If you are buying goods or services and pay through BitPay, we may also provide the seller with your confirmed credit card billing address to help complete your transaction with the seller. The seller is not allowed to use this information to market their services to you unless you have agreed to it. If an attempt to pay your seller fails, or is later invalidated, we may also provide your seller with details of the unsuccessful payment. To facilitate dispute resolutions, we may provide a buyer with the sellers address so that goods can be returned to the seller.

We work with third parties, including merchants, to enable them to accept or facilitate payments from or to you using BitPay. In doing so, a third party may share information about you with us, such as your email address or mobile phone number to inform you that a payment is sent to you or when you attempt to pay that merchant or through that third party. We use this information to confirm to that you are a BitPay customer and that BitPay as a form of payment can be enabled, or where a payment is sent to you to send you notification that you have received a payment. Also, if you request that we validate your status as a BitPay customer with a third party, we will do so. Please note that merchants you buy from and contract with have their own privacy policies, and BitPay may not be held responsible for their operations, including, but not limited to, their information practices.</SUBTEXT>
