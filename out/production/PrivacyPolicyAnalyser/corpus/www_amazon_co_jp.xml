        <SUBTITLE>What personal information about customers does Amazon.co.jp gather and for what purpose is the information used</SUBTITLE>
        <SUBTEXT>The information we learn from customers helps us personalize and continually improve your shopping experience at Amazon.co.jp and provide customers with opportunities for services such as stores, platforms and search engines that Amazon.co.jp, Amazon.com, Inc. and/or their affiliates (together, "Amazon") offer via the Internet. We use the information to handle orders, deliver products and services, process payments, communicate with you about orders, products, services and promotional offers, respond to your requests, update our records and generally maintain your accounts with us, display content such as wish lists and customer reviews and recommend merchandise and services that might be of interest to you. We also use this information to improve our store and platform, to enable you to enjoy more variety of services provided via the Internet (such as search engine services), prevent or detect fraud, abuses of our website or any other illegal activities when using our services and enable third parties to carry out technical, logistical or other functions on our behalf.

Here are the types of information we gather:

Information You Give Us: We receive and store any information you enter on our website or give us in any other way. Click here to see examples of what we collect. You can choose not to provide certain information, but then you might not be able to take advantage of many of our features.
Automatic Information: We receive and store certain types of information whenever you interact with us. For example, like many websites, we use "cookies," and we obtain certain types of information when your web browser accesses Amazon.co.jp or advertisements and other content served by or on behalf of Amazon.co.jp on other websites. See the Examples of Information Collected section further down the page for examples of the information we receive.
Mobile: When you download or use apps created by Amazon, we may receive information about your location and your mobile device, including a unique identifier for your device. We may use this information to provide you with location-based services, such as advertising, search results, and other personalized content. For more information about how to do this, click here.
E-mail Communications: To help us make e-mails more useful and interesting, we often receive a confirmation when you open e-mail from Amazon if your computer supports such capabilities. We also compare our customer list to lists received from other companies, in an effort to avoid sending unnecessary messages to our customers. If you do not want to receive e-mail or other mail from us, please adjust your Amazon.co.jp Communications preferences.
Information from Other Sources: We might receive information about you from other sources and add it to our account information. Click here to see examples of the information we receive.</SUBTEXT>

    <SECTION>
        <SUBTITLE>What about cookies</SUBTITLE>
        <SUBTEXT>Cookies are unique identifiers that we transfer to your device to enable our systems to recognize your device and to provide features such as 1-Click Purchasing, Recommended for You, personalized advertisements on other Web sites (e.g., Amazon Associates with content served by Amazon.co.jp), and storage of items in your Shopping Cart between visits.
The help feature on most browsers will tell you how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, or how to disable cookies altogether. Additionally, you can disable or delete similar data used by browser add-ons, such as flash cookies, by changing the add-on's settings or visiting the website of its manufacturer. Because cookies allow you to take advantage of some of Amazon.co.jp's essential features, we recommend that you leave them enabled. For instance, if you block or otherwise reject our cookies, you will not be able to add items to your Shopping Cart, proceed to checkout, or use any Amazon.co.jp's products and services that require you to sign in.</SUBTEXT>

    <SECTION>
        <SUBTITLE>Does Amazon.co.jp share the information it receives</SUBTITLE>
        <SUBTEXT>Information about our customers is an important part of our business, and we are not in the business of selling it to others. We share (i.e. jointly use) customer information, for such purposes as aforementioned, with subsidiaries that Amazon.com, Inc., controls, including Amazon.com Int'l Sales, Inc., Amazon Services International, Inc., and Amazon Japan K.K., that either are subject to this Privacy Notice or follow practices at least as protective as those described in this Privacy Notice.

Affiliated Businesses We Do Not Control
We work closely with affiliated businesses. In some cases, such as Marketplace sellers, these businesses operate stores at Amazon.co.jp or sell offerings to you at Amazon.co.jp. In other cases, we operate stores, provide services, or sell product lines jointly with these businesses. Click here for some examples of co-branded and joint offerings. You can tell when a third party is involved in your transactions, and we share (i.e. jointly use) or transfer customer information related to those transactions with or to that third-party pursuant to the requirements of Japanese laws.
Third-Party Service Providers
We employ other companies and individuals to perform functions on our behalf. Examples include fulfilling orders, delivering packages, sending postal mail and e-mail, removing repetitive information from customer lists, analyzing data, providing marketing assistance, providing search results and links (including paid listings and links), processing credit card payments, and providing customer service. They have access to personal information needed to perform their functions, but may not use it for other purposes.
Promotional Offers
Sometimes, we send offers to selected groups of customers on behalf of other businesses. When we do this, we do not give that business your name and address. If you do not want to receive such offers, please adjust your Customer Communications Preferences.
Business Transfers
As we continue to develop our business, Amazon might sell or buy stores, subsidiaries, or business units. In such transactions, customer information generally is one of the transferred business assets but remains subject to the promises made in any pre-existing Privacy Notice (unless, of course, the customer consents otherwise). Also, in the unlikely event that Amazon or substantially all of its assets are acquired, customer information will of course be one of the transferred assets.
Protection of Amazon and Others
We release account and other personal information subject to the requirements by applicable law when we determine release is appropriate to comply with the requirements of laws or public institutions; enforce or apply our Conditions of Use and other agreements; or protect the rights, property, or safety of Amazon, our users, or others. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection, piracy protection and credit risk reduction. Obviously, however, this does not include selling, renting, sharing, or otherwise disclosing personally identifiable information from customers for commercial purposes in violation of the commitments set forth in this Privacy Notice.
With Your Consent:	Other than as set out above, you will receive a notice when information about you might go to third parties, in order to provide you an opportunity to choose not to have your information transferred.</SUBTEXT>

    <SECTION>
        <SUBTITLE>How Secure is Information about Me</SUBTITLE>
        <SUBTEXT>At Amazon.co.jp, we work to protect the security of your information during transmission by using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) software, which encrypts information you input.
Amazon.co.jp reveals only the last four digits of your credit card numbers when confirming an order. Of course, we transmit the entire credit card number to the appropriate credit card company during order processing.
It is important for you to protect against unauthorized access to your password and to your computer. Be sure to sign off when finished using a shared computer. Click here for more information on how to sign off.</SUBTEXT>

        <SUBTITLE>Which Information Can I Access</SUBTITLE>

Click here to see some examples, the list of which will change as our website evolves.</SUBTEXT>
    </SECTION>
    <SECTION>
        <SUBTITLE>What Choices Do I Have</SUBTITLE>
        <SUBTEXT>As discussed above, you can always choose not to provide information, even though it might be needed to make a purchase or to take advantage of such Amazon.co.jp features as Your "Profile ", "Wish Lists", "Customer Reviews ", and "Amazon Prime ".
You can add or update certain information on pages such as those referenced in the "What Information Can I Access?" section on this page. When you update information, we usually keep a copy of the prior version for our records.
If you do not want to receive e-mail or other mail from us, please adjust your Customer Communication Preferences. (If you do not want to receive Conditions of Use and other legal notices from us, such as this Privacy Notice, those notices will still govern your use of Amazon.co.jp, and it is your responsibility to review them for changes.)
If you do not want us to use personal information that we gather to allow third parties to personalize advertisements that we display to you, please adjust your "Advertising Preferences".
The help feature on most browsers will tell you how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, or how to disable cookies altogether. Additionally, you can disable or delete similar data used by browser add-ons, such as flash cookies, by changing the add-on's settings or visiting the website of its manufacturer. Because cookies allow you to take advantage of some of Amazon.co.jp's essential features, we recommend that you leave them turned on.

Unless stated otherwise, our current Amazon.co.jp Privacy Notice applies to all information that we have about you and your account.
