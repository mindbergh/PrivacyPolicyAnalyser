Information collected using cookies

Like many online retailers, we and/or our third party providers use cookies to recognize you as you use or return to the Barnes &amp; Noble Websites. This is done so that we can personalize and enhance your browsing and shopping experience. "Cookies" are small files that we place on your computer's hard drive to collect information about your activities on a Barnes &amp; Noble Website. Cookies help us to: (1) speed navigation, keep track of items in your shopping bag and provide you with content that is tailored to you; (2) remember information you gave us so that you do not have to re-enter it; (3) determine the effectiveness of some of our and our third party partners' marketing efforts and communications; and (4) monitor the total number of visitors, pages viewed, and the total number of banners displayed.

Browsers are typically set to create cookies automatically. You can choose to have your browser notify you when cookies are being written to your computer or accessed, or you can disable cookies entirely. If you disable cookies, however, you will not be able to place items in a Barnes &amp; Noble Website shopping bag, and therefore you will not be able to place an order with us online.

This third party service provider may only use your personal information to perform services for us and may not share your personal information with anyone else, or use it for any other purpose, except on an aggregated, non- personally identifiable basis. For more information, please view this third party's privacy policy.

By doing business with or interacting with Barnes &amp; Noble, you consent to the use of the tracking technologies as described above.

Information collected in connection with marketing e-mails and using pixel tags or clear GIFs

To help us understand the effectiveness of certain of our communications and marketing efforts, we may use sensing technologies that use pixel tags or clear GIFs (which are also called web beacons). These technologies allow us to determine the effectiveness of our e-mail and advertising and marketing efforts. For this purpose, we tie the pixel tags and clear gifs to personally identifiable information. We may also collect information regarding the links within such marketing materials that you click on and purchase statistics regarding items you buy following receipt of such marketing.

        <SUBTITLE>9. What other information about Barnes &amp; Noble's Privacy Policy would I want to know?</SUBTITLE>
        <SUBTEXT>Barnes &amp; Noble Policies for Minors, including children under the age of 13.

Barnes &amp; Noble is committed to complying with all applicable laws and regulations regarding the collection, storage and use of personal information of Minors under the age of 13, including the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998.

Except as noted below : (i) our products and services are marketed for and directed towards purchase by adults or with the consent of adults; (ii) Individuals under the age of 18 ("Minors") are not permitted to use Barnes &amp; Noble Websites or Apps without the supervision of a parent or legal guardian; (iii) we do not knowingly collect or solicit personal information from children under the age of 13 or knowingly allow such persons to register for an online account or to post personal information on the Barnes &amp; Noble Websites; and (iv) should we learn that someone under the age of 13 has provided any personal information to or on any of the Barnes &amp; Noble Websites, we will remove that information as soon as possible.

If we direct certain Devices features or Apps to Minors who may be under the age of 13, we require the parent or legal guardian to provide verifiable consent to such Minor's use of our products and services and our collection of personal information in connection with such use. In these cases, we require validation of credit card information already on file with us and we will then e-mail the master account holder to give notice that we have received such consent. If no credit card information is on file, or if the credit card is invalid, we will not register that you have consented. With your consent, we may collect, use and share information regarding Minors under the age of 13 consistent with this Privacy Policy. Please see the sections above for detailed information on how we do so.

If you are a parent or guardian who believes that your Minor under the age of 13 has submitted personal information or other information to us without your consent, please contact privacy@barnesandnoble.com. Once we verify that you are the parent or legal guardian, at your request, we will promptly provide to you information regarding what, if any, personal information we have collected about your child and how it has been used or shared. We will, at your request, remove personal information about your child from its database and instruct our affiliates and third party partners to do the same.

Your access rights and updates to your information

You have the right to ask us not to use your personal information for direct marketing purposes. You also have the right to request a copy of the personal information that we hold about you and to have any inaccuracies rectified. Please note that, as permitted by law, we may charge a nominal fee for information requests and may require you to prove your identity. Following a request, we will use reasonable efforts to supply, correct or delete personal information about you in our files. Please address written requests and questions about this to privacy@barnesandnoble.com. We will respond to all access requests within 30 days.

Third Party Applications: We are not responsible for third party applications you may download and install on your Devices. While Barnes &amp; Noble uses reasonable efforts to ensure that applications offered through our Application Stores meet compatibility and safety testing criteria, this Privacy Policy does not cover any data collection, use, or sharing by mobile device manufacturers, network service providers or third party application providers, unless such party has entered into a separate agreement with us as a business partner to share your personal information. In such a case, we would require our business partner to disclose their data collection and sharing practices with you, and obtain your prior affirmative consent. Our use of any shared data under such an agreement would then be governed by our privacy policy. All other collection of personal information by a third party application provider shall be subject to the terms of such provider's privacy policy.

Third Party Websites and Web-Tracking

We may partner with third party distributors of advertisements to deliver advertisements about our products and services when you visit other websites across the Internet. These distributors of advertisements may place or access cookies on your computer which help us provide you with advertisements that are customized to your particular product preferences and improve the effectiveness of our marketing efforts. If you would like to learn more about the third party advertisers that may be aware of the fact that you visit Barnes &amp; Noble Websites, and to understand your choices about having such advertisers' cookies turned off, please visit www.networkadvertising.org. Please note this does not opt you out of being served advertising. You will continue to receive generic ads.

Please understand that Barnes &amp; Noble does not control these third party cookies, and you should check the privacy policy of the Internet advertising company or advertiser to see whether and how it uses cookies.
