To comply with the law. We will not disclose Customer Data to a third party (including law enforcement, other government entity or civil litigant) except as you direct or required by law.

Cookies

Most Microsoft web sites use "cookies," which are small text files placed on a device's hard disk by a web server. We may use cookies for:

Storing your Preferences and Settings. When a user enters a city or postal code to get local news or weather information on a Microsoft site, we may store that city or postal code in a cookie. This can save time by eliminating the need to repeatedly enter the same information.
Sign-in, Authentication, and Fraud Detection. When a user signs in to a site or service using a Microsoft or organizational account, we store the user's unique ID number and sign-in time, in an encrypted cookie on the user's hard disk. This cookie allows the user to move from page to page at the site without having to sign in again on each page. When the user signs out, these cookies are deleted from the user's computer. We also use cookies to improve the sign-in experience. For example, a user's email address may be stored in a cookie that will remain on his or her computer after sign out. This cookie allows the user's email address to be pre-populated, so that the user will only need to type the password at the next sign in. Users who do not want this information to be stored can select the appropriate radio button on the sign-in page.
Site Analytics. We may use cookies to count the number of unique visitors to a web page or service or to develop other aggregate statistics about the operations of our sites and services. These analytics help us operate and improve the performance and usability of these sites and services.
Advertising. Most of the online advertisements on Microsoft sites are displayed by Microsoft Advertising. When we display online advertisements to you, we will place one or more persistent cookies on your computer in order to recognize your computer each time we display an ad to you. Because we serve advertisements on our own websites as well as those of our advertising and publisher partners, we are able to compile information over time about the types of pages, content and ads you, or others who are using your computer, visited or viewed. This information is used for many purposes, for example, it helps us try to ensure that you do not see the same advertisements over and over again. We also use this information to help select and display targeted advertisements that we believe may be of interest to you.
Some of the cookies we commonly use are listed in the following chart. This list is not exhaustive, but it is intended to illustrate some of the reasons we set cookies. If you visit one of our web sites, the site may set some or all of the following cookies:

Cookie name


Description

MUID


Identifies unique browsers to Microsoft sites. It is used for site analytics and other operational purposes.

TenantId


Cookie for Storing the Tenant ID

SessID


Sets a unique ID identifying the user session. . It is used for site analytics and other operational purposes.

CC


Contains a country code as determined by reverse IP address lookup.

Microsoft account authentication


Authentication cookies (e.g., IntuneID, wsresult, ) used when a user signs in with an organizational account.

RedirectToFullSite


Cookie that stores if the user would like to view the full site instead of the mobile site



In addition to the cookies Microsoft may set when you users visit our web sites, third parties may also set certain cookies on your hard drive when users you visit Microsoft sites. In some cases, that is because we have hired the third party to provide certain services on our behalf, such as site analytics.

How to Control Cookies
Browser Controls to Block Cookies. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to block cookies.

For example, in Internet Explorer 9, you may block cookies by taking the following steps:

Click "Tools" and then select "Internet Options"
Click the "Privacy" tab at the top of the window
Move the slider up or down to select the types of cookies you wish to block
Instructions for blocking cookies in other browsers are available at http://www.allaboutcookies.org/manage-cookies/.

Please be aware that users who choose to block cookies may not be able to sign in or use other interactive features of Microsoft sites and services that depend on cookies.

Browser Controls to Delete Cookies. If you accept cookies, you can delete them later.

For example, in Internet Explorer 9, you may delete cookies by taking the following steps:

Click "Tools" and then select "Internet Options"
On the "General" tab, under "Browsing History," click the "Delete" button
On the pop-up, select the box next to “Cookies”
Click the "Delete" button
Instructions for deleting cookies in other browsers are available at http://www.allaboutcookies.org/manage-cookies/.

Please be aware that if you choose to delete cookies, any settings and preferences controlled by those cookies, including advertising preferences, will be deleted and may need to be recreated.

Browser Controls for “Do Not Track” and Tracking Protection. Some newer browsers have incorporated “Do Not Track” features. Most of these features, when turned on, send a signal or preference to the web sites you visit indicating that you do not wish to be tracked. Those sites may continue to engage in activities you might view as tracking even though you have expressed this preference, depending on the sites' privacy practices.

Internet Explorer 9 and later has a feature called Tracking Protection that helps prevent the web sites you go to from automatically sending details about your visit to third-party content providers. When you add a Tracking Protection List, Internet Explorer will block third-party content, including cookies, from any site that is listed as a site to be blocked. By limiting calls to these sites, Internet Explorer will limit the information these third-party sites can collect about you. And when you have a Tracking Protection List enabled, Internet Explorer will send a Do Not Track signal or preference to the web sites you visit. For more information about Tracking Protection Lists and how to find them, please see the Internet Explorer privacy statement or Internet Explorer Help.
