Personal Information We Collect

At every touch point or guest interaction, and in conducting every aspect of our business, we may collect personal information. This personal information may include: your contact information; information related to your reservation, stay or visit to a property; participation in a membership or loyalty program; participation in a sweepstakes or marketing program (even if you do not stay at one of our hotels); information related to the purchase and receipt of products or services; personal characteristics, nationality, income, passport number and date and place of issue; travel history; payment information; guest preferences; marketing and communication preferences; information about vehicles you may bring onto our properties; reviews and opinions about our Portfolio of Brands or properties (if they are identified or associated with you); frequent flyer or travel partner program affiliation and member number; hotel, airline and rental car packages booked; groups with which you are associated for stays at hotels; information needed to administer the HHonors program and profiles, including transaction and correspondence details; information provided on membership and account applications; and other types of information that you choose to provide to us or that we may obtain from third parties. We may also record details on joint travelers, including their names and frequent flyer numbers, and the age of the driver of the rental car. We may also collect and keep information and records related to conversations, including recording or monitoring customer service calls.

In addition we collect other personal information in certain cases, such as:

HHonors: When you enroll in our HHonors program, we will also ask you to indicate whether you are at least 18 years old, and we will record an HHonors number and password for you. When you manage your profile online, you have the opportunity to provide additional information about your preferred airline partners and your loyalty program account numbers with them, your room type preferences, your language preferences, your credit card account(s), your email subscription preferences for receiving news, offers and information from us, and to create a User ID and password. Also, when you book a Rewards Reservation or purchase HHonors Points online, we may ask for additional specific account information such as corporate account number, group or convention code, travel agent number or AAA number.
Surveys: We may request demographic data or other personal information in customer surveys.
On-property Collection: Local laws may require that we collect additional personal information during registration/check-in at our properties. We may also use closed circuit television and other security measures at our properties that may capture or record images of guests, visitors in public areas and information related to your location while on our properties via keycards and other technologies. We may also use other technologies that record sound or video to protect our staff. In addition, we may collect personal information in connection with on-property services, such as concierge services, health clubs, spas, activities, child care services, and equipment rental.
Event Profiles: If you plan an event with us, we collect meeting and event specifications, the date of the event, number of guests, details of the guest rooms, and, for corporate events, information on your organization (name, annual budget, and number of sponsored events per year). We also collect information about the guests that are a part of your group or event. If you visit us as part of a group, we may have personal information about you provided to us by the group and may market to you as a result of your stay with a group or attendance at an event. If you visit us as part of an event, we may share personal information about you with the event planners so they may include you as part of the event. If you are an event planner we may also share information about your event with third-party service providers who may market event services to you.
Hilton Grand Vacations Timeshare: If you submit an online "pre-application" for timeshare or if you submit a reservation or information request online, or participate in an online "click-to-chat" type feature, we may ask you to provide your annual income range or reservation information. If you attend a Hilton Grand Vacations event, or preview tour, or enter a sweepstakes, we may ask you to provide information about your family composition, travel preferences, frequency of travel and other vacation history information. If you register for an online account with Hilton Grand Vacations Club and/or The Hilton Club, or other club products or programs introduced from time to time, we may also ask you to provide your member or reservation number, and security codes. If you finance the purchase of a timeshare, we may collect loan application and servicing information.
Online Accounts: When you register an online account (e.g., as a member of Hilton Grand Vacations Club and/or The Hilton Club, or another club product or program), we also ask you to select a username and password.
Social Media: If you choose to participate in Hilton-sponsored social media activities or offerings, we may collect certain information from your social media account consistent with your settings within the social media service, such as location, check-ins, activities, interests, photos, status updates and friend list. You should understand that you may be subject to the terms and conditions and any privacy policies of the social media site and that Hilton is not responsible for your activities on social media sites.
Forward-to-a-Friend: From time to time, we may offer a feature that allows you to send an electronic postcard or otherwise share a message with a friend, whether via the Internet, a stand-alone kiosk or mobile. If you choose to do so, we will ask you for the recipient's name and email address, along with the text of any message you choose to include, or you may be able to use a pre-populated message. By using this feature, you represent that you are entitled to use and provide us with the recipient's name and email address for this purpose.
Franchise Opportunities: If you are interested in obtaining more information about franchise opportunities, we may also collect information about your specific interests, such as brand, type of ownership and information about your property type such as current ownership, size of parcel, location of parcel, number of rooms, height limitation and time frame for planning or acquisition.
Employment Applications: If you choose to apply online for employment with Hilton, please see our Applicant Privacy Notice.
WMBE Suppliers: If your U.S. company is a Women's/Minority Business Enterprise interested in participating in Hilton's Supplier Diversity Program, you may complete the Supplier Diversity Profile Application Form online. If you choose to apply, you will be asked to provide information about your company and its principals, including the principal's name, address, email address, ethnicity, contact person's name and email address, company's tax identification number and legal structure, and evidence of Women's/Minority Business Enterprise certification.</SUBTEXT>

        <SUBTEXT>In addition to the information we collect from you directly, we may also infer information about you based on the information you provide to us or from Other Information we receive.

        <SUBTITLE>Use of Personal Information Collected About You</SUBTITLE>
        <SUBTEXT>We use your personal information to provide the services you request from Hilton, or which are part of a program you have joined or a purchase you have made. We also use your personal information to provide you with information about meeting and event planning and access to specific account information for administrative purposes. In addition, we may use your information to: improve Hilton's services; provide you with the expected level of hospitality; ensure our site, products and services are of interest to you; process enrollments and applications; and facilitate collections. We also use the information to provide or offer you newsletters, promotions and featured specials, other marketing communications, product or service awareness marketing, and to conduct surveys, sweepstakes, prize draws, and other contests. We may provide these communications online, via email, telephone, mobile/text messaging (including SMS and MMS) and postal mail. We may also aggregate your personal information with data from third-party sources for purposes of data hygiene and analytics.

eFolio Program: In order to provide the most efficient service, we encourage you to receive your hotel bill via email ("eFolio"). All guests will be automatically enrolled in this program. However, you can choose to receive a paper receipt by making such request upon check in or at any time during your stay prior to your departure date. The email address you provided upon making your reservation, or if you are an HHonors member and did not change your email address upon making your reservation, your email address of record, will be used to send you your eFolio. If you would like your eFolio to be sent to a different email address, you can make that request upon check-in or at any time during your stay prior to your departure date. Further, we do not have any mechanism for verifying your email address, so it is your responsibility to ensure that we have the correct (and preferred) email address for you. If you make a reservation for another person and use your email address, your email address will be used to provide their receipt.

        <SUBTITLE>How We Share Personal Information</SUBTITLE>
        <SUBTEXT>As a global company, we endeavor to provide you with the same level of service that you have come to expect at Hilton whether you are in San Francisco, London or Tokyo. To provide this service, we may share your personal information among members of the Hilton Worldwide Portfolio of Brands, including Hilton Grand Vacations, franchisees, managed hotels, or service providers that may be located in countries outside your own. Although the data protection laws of these various countries may not be as comprehensive as those in your own country, Hilton will take appropriate steps to ensure that your personal information is handled as described in this Statement.

Hilton Worldwide Portfolio of Brands: We may share personal information with other companies within the Hilton Worldwide Portfolio of Brands, including Hilton Grand Vacations, that may jointly use the personal information for the purposes described above. Hilton Worldwide, Inc. is the party responsible for the management of the jointly used personal information.
Franchised Hotels, Managed Hotels, Timeshare and Fractional Resorts: We may share personal information with owners and operators of franchised hotels, owners of hotels that we manage but do not own, and timeshare or fractional ownership resorts in order to provide you with services. In addition, when we cease managing a hotel that we do not own, we may provide the hotel's owner with limited information about past or future guests of that hotel.
Electronic Billing Program: If you participate in a corporate electronic billing program or the eFolio program, billing information will be shared with the credit card provider and if you use a corporate credit card, possibly, your employer.
Group Events or Meetings: If you visit Hilton as part of a group event or meeting, information collected for meeting and event planning may be shared with the organizers of those meetings and events, and, where appropriate, guests who organize or participate in the meeting or event.
Business Partners: From time to time we may partner with other companies to provide products or services and may share your information with our business partners to provide those products or services to you. For example, we may help to arrange rental car or other services from our business partners, and share personal information with our business partners in order to provide those services. If you are an HHonors member, we may share your personal information with our business partners in order to credit you with mileage or other benefits earned through your participation in the HHonors program.
Co-Sponsors of Promotions: We also may co-sponsor promotions, sweepstakes, prize draws, competitions or contests with other companies, or we may provide prizes for sweepstakes and contests sponsored by other companies. If you enter one of these sweepstakes or contests, we may share your information with our co-sponsor or the third-party sponsor.
On-property Services: We may share personal information with providers of on-property services that provide services such as concierge services, spa treatments, golf, or dining experiences.
Service Providers: We rely on service providers to provide certain products and services, such as to facilitate administrative functions and information technology operations, credit card billing, reservations services, administering the HHonors program, the Hilton Grand Vacations Club and The Hilton Club program, providing services in connection with our websites, including airline and rental car packages; communicating news and delivering promotional and transactional materials via email, direct mail, and online and mobile advertising; processing credit card transactions, data hygiene and enhancement services; professional services such as accounting, auditing and legal advice; investigating accident reports; processing insurance claims; and administering sweepstakes, prize draws, competitions and customer surveys. Hilton will disclose personal information to service providers as appropriate.
Business Transactions: As we develop our business, we might sell, buy, restructure or reorganize businesses or assets. In the event of a merger, consolidation, sale, liquidation or transfer of assets, Hilton may, in its sole and absolute discretion, transfer, sell or assign information collected, including, without limitation, Other Information and personal information, to one or more affiliated or unaffiliated third parties.
Telemarketing: If you stay at a Hilton Hotel or are an HHonors member, we may share your telephone number among our Portfolio of Brands, including Hilton Grand Vacations, for purposes of telemarketing. We may also receive your telephone number from our partners or from other sources, which we may use for telemarketing purposes.
