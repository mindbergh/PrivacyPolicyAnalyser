We provide the information to trusted partners who work on behalf of or with us. These companies may use your personal information to help communicate with you about offers from us and our marketing partners. These companies are authorized to use your personal information only as necessary to provide these services to us. Examples of these are third party payment processors who expedite payments on our Website and marketing partners, such as our identity theft protection partner.
We respond to subpoenas, court orders, or legal process, or to establish or exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims.
We believe it is necessary to share information in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, violations of our Terms and Conditions, or as otherwise required by law.

We may display targeted advertisements based on personal information. Advertisers (including ad serving companies) may assume that people who interact with, view, or click on targeted ads meet the targeting criteria - for example, women ages 18-24 from a particular geographic area.
We do not provide any personal information to the advertiser when you interact with or view a targeted advertisement. However, by interacting with or viewing an advertisement you are consenting to the possibility that the advertiser will make the assumption that you meet the targeting criteria used to display the advertisement.</SUBTEXT>
