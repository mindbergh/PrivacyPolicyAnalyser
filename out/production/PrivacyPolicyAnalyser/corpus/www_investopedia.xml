Data Processing/Safe Harbor

The European Union ("EU") maintains strict privacy laws. These rules differ significantly from U.S. laws. To reconcile these differences, the U.S. and the EU have created a safe harbor (“U.S.-EU Safe Harbor Framework”) that defines mutually acceptable privacy operations. The U.S. and Switzerland have created a similar safe harbor (“U.S.-Swiss Safe Harbor Framework”). For more information see www.export.gov/safeharbor.

Investopedia complies with the U.S.-EU and U.S.-Swiss Safe Harbor Frameworks as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal information from European Union member countries and Switzerland. We have certified that we adhere to the Safe Harbor Privacy Principles of notice, choice, onward transfer, security, data integrity, access, and enforcement. To learn more about the Safe Harbor program, and to view the company's certification, please visit http://www.export.gov/safeharbor/.

In compliance with the U.S.-EU and U.S.-Swiss Safe Harbor Privacy Principles, Investopedia commits to resolve complaints about your privacy and our collection or use of your personal information. European Union or Swiss citizens with inquiries or complaints regarding this privacy policy should first contact Investopedia at privacy@investopedia.com

Investopedia has further committed to refer unresolved privacy complaints under the U.S.-EU and U.S.-Swiss Safe Harbor Privacy Principles to an independent dispute resolution mechanism, the BBB EU SAFE HARBOR, operated by the Council of Better Business Bureaus. If you do not receive timely acknowledgment of your complaint, or if your complaint is not satisfactorily addressed by Investopedia please visit the BBB EU SAFE HARBOR website at www.bbb.org/us/safe-harbor-complaints for more information and to file a complaint.</SUBTEXT>
