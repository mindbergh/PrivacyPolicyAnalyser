        <SUBTITLE>Information Collected from Art Collectors</SUBTITLE>
        <SUBTEXT>In order to maintain the relevance and integrity of all questions  that are posted on our site, we require art collectors  to open a free account and provide their contact information before posting questions.  The collected information includes: first name, last name, city, state, zipcode, and e-mail address.  This information is disclosed on the website at the sole discretion of the collector.  When posting questions, the collector has the option of posting "openly" or "confidentially".  If the collector selects "openly", then all of the collector's contact information will be posted along with the question.  If "confidentally" is selected, then only the following information will be submitted: the collector's city, state, and zipcode.  This information will reveal the location of the collector, but not his / her identity.



The submitted question (including any submitted contact information) will only be viewable by registered artists and galleries.  At the end of each day, all questions are e-mailed to artists and galleries throughout the United States and Canada.  In addition, the questions are stored in a database which the artists and galleries may access after logging into their secure area of the FineArtAmerica.com website.



Art collectors have the ability to remove their question at any time.  This action will remove their question from the FineArtAmerica.com database and prevent artists and galleries from viewing or responding to the deleted question.



Questions will automatically be deleted from the database after thirty days.</SUBTEXT>
