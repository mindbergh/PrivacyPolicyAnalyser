Every computer is assigned a different cookie by Wellness.com. The information collected by cookies can also help the company dynamically generate content on web pages specifically designed for your interests and also allows the company to statistically monitor how many people are using the site and for what purpose.

Wellness.com does not control these third parties' use of cookies, or how they manage the non-Personal Information they gather through them. However, we do require Ad Servers to agree that they will not collect any Personal Information from user's visit to a third party advertisement without your consent and to agree they will not link any non-personal cookie information collected by their advertisement to Personal Information they or others collect in other ways or from other websites.

        <SUBTITLE>Protecting your Personal Information</SUBTITLE>
        <SUBTEXT>Wellness.com, Inc. takes reasonable technological and physical security measures to protect each user's Personal Information; however, users must protect their own passwords and log-in information themselves. The Company cannot protect a user's Personal Information from a third-party who has obtained their log-in and password credentials legally or illegally. Users are cautioned to take great care to protect their own passwords. Some recommended strategies to help protect passwords are as follows:

Always select a password that is a mixture of at least 7 letters and numbers that cannot be easily associated with your known personal information.
Never enter your password in the presence of another person who could watch you type it.
Never use the same password on different websites that are insecure or possibly run by companies which do not protect your Personal Information.</SUBTEXT>

It is not technologically reasonable to remove each and every record of the information you have provided to Wellness.com from our computers servers.

Privacy as it applies to the Internet is a dynamic, rapidly developing area. In the future, the company may make significant changes to its privacy policy affecting the use of the Personal Information it collects. The company will notify users by email of any significant material changes to its privacy policy and obtain your "opt-in" consent to any significant new uses of your Personal Information, if it was collected from you prior to a significant change in this policy. The company may also make non-significant changes to our Privacy Policy that generally will not affect the use of your Personal Information. You should also check this posted Privacy Policy for any future changes. If you do not agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy or any revised policy, please exit the site immediately and terminate your membership in Wellness.com.
