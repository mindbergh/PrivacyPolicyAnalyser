        <SUBTITLE>Collection of Personal Data</SUBTITLE>
        <SUBTEXT>Personal data is information that identifies you or can be used to identify or contact you, such as your name, e-mail address, postal address, or phone number ("Personal Data"). Newsmax may collect Personal Data from you when you enroll in, subscribe to or agree to purchase any of our paid goods and services, or register for news alerts on the Newsmax Offerings. In addition to information collected during registration, enrollment, subscription or purchase, Newsmax may collect Personal Data knowingly provided by you in e-mails to the Newsmax Offerings, online forms, order and registration forms, surveys, polls, sweepstakes, and contest entries. Providing this information is always at your option, although your failure to provide Personal Data in such instances may limit your ability to use such features of the Newsmax Offerings.

In all of these cases, we will collect Personal Data from you only if you voluntarily submit such information to us. We will not sell, share, license, trade or rent your Personal Data other than as specified in this Privacy Policy, unless we have your consent to do so. We may, from time to time in emails, alerts or other mailings you have agreed to accept from us, include advertisements, sponsorships, other offers from or information about third parties. This does not and will not mean that Newsmax endorses any specific products or services available from such third parties. Such materials from those third parties, regardless of their relationship with us, are provided merely for information purposes and users should make their own judgments and evaluation of any services or products available on any other websites. You do not have to provide us with any Personal Data to visit the Newsmax Offerings. However, if you choose to withhold requested information, you may not be able to visit all sections or use all features of the Newsmax Offerings.</SUBTEXT>

        <SUBTITLE>Collection of Monitoring Data and Use of Tracking Tools</SUBTITLE>
        <SUBTEXT>In addition to Personal Data, Newsmax and service providers it engages may collect and/or track information that by itself is not used to identify you personally or to contact you, such as demographic information, domain names, computer type, browser types, screen resolution, and other anonymous statistical data involving the use of the Newsmax Offerings ("Monitoring Data"). We use Monitoring Data to help us understand who uses the Newsmax Offerings and to improve Newsmax's websites.

To enhance the Internet experience on the Newsmax Offerings, Newsmax and service providers it engages may use various Internet technologies such as, ‘cookies,' ‘web beacons,' ‘action tags,' ‘web bug,' ‘.gif tags,' and ‘JavaScript' (together, "Tracking Tools"). Tracking Tools are files or tools that are placed on your computer in order to identify your Web browser and the activities of your computer on the Newsmax Offerings. Newsmax uses these technologies to customize and enhance the Internet experience of individual users. When you revisit the Newsmax Offerings, Newsmax may recognize you by a Tracking Tool and customize your experience accordingly. For example, once you have completed the registration process, a cookie will be used to remember your registration preferences. You may decline Internet cookies, if any, by using the appropriate feature of your Web browser software, if available. If cookies are disabled, however, all features of the Newsmax Offerings may not operate as intended. Information about the procedure you are required to follow in order to disable cookies can be found on your Internet browser provider's website.

We believe Tracking Tool technologies add value to the user experience, and the information obtained through these technologies is not sold or otherwise made available to third parties by Newsmax, other than as may from time to time be specified in this Privacy Policy.</SUBTEXT>
