INFORMATION ABOUT YOU (INFORMATION YOU TYPE IN)
After download, the App solicits information from you.  You may access most tools and features either as a guest, or logged in with your SkyMiles credentials, including SkyMiles number, last name and SkyMiles account PIN.  Logging in allows the added convenience of access to SkyMiles account information if needed while traveling.  However, if you do not log in and use the application as a guest, you still have access to most features.
You are given the option to enter travel-related and personal information while using certain features of the App. The App allows you to enter and store personal information for use in travel clearance functions. The information you enter may include first and last name, passport or government ID (number, country of issue, expiration date), passenger redress number, gender, date of birth, and country of residence.  To use the feature allowing direct payment of baggage and travel-related fees through the App, you will need to provide your payment information, including payment card number, expiration date and billing address.  You may also choose to store photos and text notes for parking and travel reminders, along with company travel information, travel preferences and phone or e-mail contact information needed to communicate with others in transit.
AUTOMATIC ACCESS AND DATA COLLECTION FROM YOUR DEVICE
The App may access certain device information and/or components automatically.  This access is only for the purpose of providing the services within the App you choose to use.
A push notification token (not your native manufacturer device ID) will be used to send push notifications to your mobile device with updates for flight times, gate changes and flight cancellations.  The App will activate your camera if you choose to take a picture for a parking reminder, and store the photo.  If you choose, the App can access your device calendar to save itinerary information in your personal schedule.  It can also bring up your default e-mail program to enable you to send notes and reminders while traveling.  The calendar and photo functions are user-initiated.
LOCATION INFORMATION
If you have first provided permission through your device, Delta may obtain pinpointed physical location information from technologies like GPS, Wi-Fi, or cell tower proximity. You are able to withdraw your permission for Delta to acquire pinpointed location information from your device through your device settings, although Delta does not control this process.  The App can use the geo-location features (GPS or network-based) to support your use of location-based tools such as airport/map views, city code search, displaying local Delta Sky Clubs, and locating parking spaces.
HOW WE USE INFORMATION ABOUT YOU AND YOUR DEVICE
We collect and use the information about you and your device collected through this App, as well as other information obtained from our website or network and your device, your account, to maintain and provide you with the Services, to respond to your questions and instructions, to maintain the integrity of our network and address security issues, to investigate or take action regarding violations or suspected violations of law or our terms, and to improve such Services.
At times, we may promote the Fly Delta app via internet advertising.  If you click on such an advertisement on an external web site and navigate directly to the iTunes App Store or other platform, non-identifying information such as your phone's device number may be sent to the advertising network, so that they and we may track the effectiveness (i.e., conversions) of our advertising.
In addition to conversion events, it might also be used for frequency capping, estimating the number of unique users, debugging, or security and fraud detection.
TRACKING PREFERENCES AND OPT-OUT
You may at any time opt-out from further allowing the App's access to your location data by disabling location tracking features as provided in your native device settings features.
You may also refrain from using application features that collect specific types of data.
You may opt-out of all information collection by uninstalling the App.  You may use the standard uninstall, application and data management processes available as part of your mobile device or via the removal features provided in your chosen mobile app store or network.  Once you have uninstalled the App, all information it stored is deleted, including any preferences you previously set around location permissions and whether you've allowed Delta to send you push notifications. Once the App is uninstalled and preferences are deleted, the push notifications stop.
When you use Fly Delta, a unique ID (which varies by device manufacturer and operating system) is read from or associated with your device to be used as an anonymous identifier for analytics and performance purposes.  We don't store the ID, or share the ID or other unique information collected or used by the app with third parties, except for service providers such as Adobe, whose analytics product generates this ID to track and analyze the performance of our app.  We do not use information gathered within the app to serve you targeted advertisements. The "limit ad tracking" or similar advertising-related privacy settings offered by device manufacturers do not change how your device is tracked by Delta.

SHARING WITH SOCIAL MEDIA
You may wish to share information and activities from this app with social media platforms. To utilize social media sharing features, you will be prompted to grant permissions within those platforms, as you choose.   For Facebook updates, you will need to allow account login and publishing permissions.  This enables you to: post questions and content to a feed, upload photos/videos, add likes and comments, create notes and post to events and groups.  To facilitate login, the app will store your account credentials for the appropriate social media platform.
Activity and data shared from the app to these platforms is covered by the internal privacy policy of each platform.
DATA RETENTION
The App will store user- provided data for as long as you use the related feature of the App, unless you choose to delete it.  Only information provided for travel clearance, purchases and related activities will be stored in our operational systems as needed to provide your requested services.  As with the website, if you delete your Delta Sky Miles Account, we will delete the data stored in that account.
SECURITY
Information Security is important to Delta. We have established appropriate physical, electronic and managerial safeguards to protect the information we collect from or about our users. These safeguards are regularly reviewed to protect against unauthorized access, disclosure and improper use of your information, and to maintain the accuracy and integrity of that data.
