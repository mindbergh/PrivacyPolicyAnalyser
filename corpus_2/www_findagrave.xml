        <SUBTEXT>Find A Grave, Inc. works with several third parties that serve ads on this site. Each company has different privacy policies and we are compelled to include them here. We do not share our contibutor information with any of the third-party advertisers!

We use third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit our Web site. These companies may use aggregated information (not including your name, address, email address or telephone number) about your visits to this and other Web sites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you. If you would like more information about this practice and to know your choices about not having this information used by these companies, click here.

All users who receive an ad served at the Find A Grave website retain complete anonymity where Find A Grave is concerned. As ads are delivered, Find A Grave and its advertisers do not acquire or collect any personal information about you. Your name, address, phone number, and email address all remain your private properties. Find A Grave does, however, collect information which is specific to how you use the Internet. Find A Grave servers note non-personally identifying details such as, but not limited to, the server you are logged onto, the geographic location of the ISP you use, the type of browser you use, and your IP address. This information is obtained solely for the purpose of site statistics generation, targeting ads and measuring a given ad's effectiveness. Please note that this policy applies to all webpages served within the findagrave.com domain as well as the auxillary domains including findagrave.org, findagrave.net, cemeteryrecords.com, cemeteryrecordsonline.com and remembermyfamily.com.

This privacy policy does not extend to any site or sites that a user may navigate to should the user exit the Find A Grave website by clicking on an advertisement or other link. Intentional misuse of the Find A Grave website voids this privacy statement. Intentional misuse includes but is not limited to posting illicit images, posting information or images known to be inaccurate and posting offensive or inflammatory 'virtual flowers'.

As Find A Grave's business continues to grow, Find A Grave may buy or sell subsidiaries or business units. In these transactions, customer information is often one of the transferred assets. Also, in the event that Find A Grave, or substantially all of its assets are acquired, customer information will, as a matter of course, be one of the transferred assets.

This policy may be updated by Find A Grave at any time. Changes will be posted to the website.</SUBTEXT>
