        <SUBTEXT>Privacy Policy

Your Privacy and Security are a Top Priority at iHerb. Since our inception back in 1996, iHerb has never shared, rented, or sold any customer information to any other party -- and never will.

When you submit personal information on our website we will protect your information both online and offline.
We use a variety of security technologies and procedures to help protect your personal information from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure once we receive it. For example, we store your personal information on computer systems located in limited access, secured facilities. iHerb.com employees are trained and kept up-to-date on our security procedures.
iHerb takes reasonable and appropriate steps to protect your personal information from unauthorized disclosure or access. However, no data transmitted over the internet or stored on a server can ever be 100% secured. Therefore, while we strive to protect your privacy and personal information, we cannot guarantee the security of any information transmitted or disclosed to us online. We are not responsible for the disclosure, destruction or theft of your personal information.
If you opted to register with us, you established a password for your account, in which case your online account information will be protected by your password.

You are responsible for the confidentiality of your account and password and are fully responsible for all activities that occur under your account and password. We suggest creating challenging passwords such as those with alphanumeric combinations.</SUBTEXT>
