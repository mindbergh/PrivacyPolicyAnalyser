        <SUBTITLE>Collection and Use of Personal Information</SUBTITLE>
        <SUBTEXT>When you request information, order a product or service, register using one of our forms, donate, or contact us offline, we may need your specific information in order to process your registration/request and reply promptly.

We may ask you for contact information (such as your name, email and address) and demographic information (such as your zip code or age). We also collect demographic and profile data at our site and in our databases. We ask for health-related data to help us help you through our information, our programs and our services. We use data you provide to tailor your experience at ADA and develop and distribute content that we think you might be interested in.

In general, we use identifiable information to complete a transaction, as indicated below. Part of our mission is to improve the lives of all people affected by diabetes, and we do that by providing appropriate health information. We do not provide your name and address or email to outside parties, except as described here. To learn more about our encryption policies, please review the section on "Protecting Personal Information" (below).</SUBTEXT>

        <SUBTITLE>Collection of Personally Identifiable Information and Cookies</SUBTITLE>
        <SUBTEXT>We collect standard information, by way of a cookie, to help us evaluate how our sites are being used. A cookie is a small uniquely identifiable text file that is stored on your machine. A cookie collects information that is used for statistical purposes and does not identify you in any way.

Our sites use cookies to keep track of your shopping cart and to make sure you don't see the same content repeatedly. We use cookies to deliver information specific to your interests and to save your password so you don't have to re-enter it each time you visit our site.

Most Web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can change your browser settings to prevent that. Even without accepting cookies, you can still use most of the features throughout the American Diabetes Association Web sites.

ADA Policies Regarding Disclosure of Personal Information

ADA, like many other non-profit organizations, occasionally makes available only our contributor names and postal addresses to companies, predominantly other non-profit organizations. In addition, member and donor names are provided to a credit card vendor as part of our affinity program. Names of Tour de CureÂ® participants may be provided to local bike shops. These practices help us reduce costs of reaching more individuals with our diabetes-related information. These companies are carefully screened.

Names/addresses are provided on a one-time basis; therefore, these companies will not have continued access to your name and address unless you respond to them directly, which you are free to do or not to do.

You can request that we do not share your information by emailing us at privacy@diabetes.org. (If you use more than one email address , postal address or telephone number, please identify each one.)
The American Diabetes Association may provide aggregate statistics about our customers, sales, traffic patterns, and related site information to reputable third-party vendors, but these statistics will include no personal identifying information.</SUBTEXT>

        <SUBTITLE>Our Commitment to Children's Privacy</SUBTITLE>
        <SUBTEXT>Protecting the privacy of the very young is especially important. We adhere to the 1998 Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA). (For more information, visit the Federal Trade Commission's COPPA site.

Special Considerations for Parents and Legal Guardians Regarding Planet D and Diabetes CampMessage Boards

Protecting the privacy of the very young is especially important. Children under age 13 are prohibited from entering the diabetes.org Message Board area.

PlanetD Message Boards: PlanetD is designed to be a safe place for children and youth to exchange messages. No personally identifiable information is collected during the PlanetD Message Board registration process.

Diabetes Camp Message Boards: Access to the Diabetes Camp Message Boards is controlled; only children and youth who have attended an ADA sponsored, supported, or affiliated Diabetes Camp are provided access. To ensure authentication, personally identifiable information (first name, last name, and a child's email address) are collected, along with the email address of a parent or legal guardian. This information is collected only for authentication purposes, and is securely stored, and never used for another purpose, and never shared with third-parties. It is our recommendation that children, especially children under 13, have an email account that is connected to their parent or guardian, so that the parent or guardian is notified about the child's email activity.

Parents and legal guardians are encouraged to contact the American Diabetes. Association at any time regarding privacy questions or concern. Parents and legal guardians may also contact us at any time to request that we delete a child's PlanetD-ID and/or CampDiabetes Message Board registration information and/or refuse to permit further access to the PlanetD and CampDiabetes Message Boards . We will take steps to ensure that any person contacting us for a child's information is that child's parent or guardian.
