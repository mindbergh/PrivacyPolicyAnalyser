Third Parties' Personal Information

We will retain in your My Account, the Personal Information of individuals for whom you have made reservations.

You can access or modify these third parties' Personal Information at any time, as described in How to access, modify, or close your account.

Retention and Storage

        <SUBTITLE>How we protect Personal Information</SUBTITLE>
        <SUBTEXT>CheapTickets employs physical, administrative and technical safeguards to help protect the confidentiality and integrity of Personal Information and to reduce the risk of loss, misuse, unauthorized access, disclosure or modification of Personal Information. When Personal Information is sent to our service providers, we require in our contracts with them that they protect all Personal Information in a manner consistent with the principles articulated in this Privacy Policy.

If you choose to contact CheapTickets through our Site, you should be aware that any information transmitted electronically via the World Wide Web might not be secure. CheapTickets assumes no liability for the loss of any information that you transmit to us via the World Wide Web. However, if you provide your credit card information on our Site's credit card forms, we encrypt the transmission of that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL).

In communicating with you, we may send e-mail as unencrypted plain text because we are aware that most Members and Guests cannot readily process encrypted e-mail. This is done for your convenience, but with the security concern that, if misrouted or intercepted, it could be read more easily than encrypted e-mail.

If you wish to close your account, you can do so by contacting us as indicated in Contact Information. We will respond to such requests within 30 days following receipt at the e-mail or mailing address stated above. If we receive your request at a different e-mail or mailing address, we will respond within a reasonable period of time, but not to exceed 150 days from the date received.

These features may collect your IP address, which page you are visiting on our Site, and may set a cookie to enable the feature to function properly.
