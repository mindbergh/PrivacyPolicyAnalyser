        <SUBTITLE>PRIVACY POLICY</SUBTITLE>
        <SUBTEXT>GSMArena.com takes privacy issues very seriously. Submission of personal information is not required in order to browse the website. We use demographic and traffic information of our users only to analyze the readers community and may also provide it to potential advertisers and business partners. This does not include personal reader information. Submission of this information on GSMArena.com is always optional and will never be provided to third parties.
To ensure that users email addresses will not get in any bulk mail lists or newsletters, we at GSMArena modify the addresses so any email collecting scripts will not be able to gather them. Besides that, only in the Forum section of the website it is obligatory for the user to provide an email address in order to complete the registration. The Forum section (software by phpBB) requires certain user information in order to take full advantage of the software features. This information will never be provided to third parties.</SUBTEXT>

        <SUBTEXT>We may use third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit our Web Site. If so, a list of these ad serving companies will be available here. These companies may use information (generally, not including your name, address, e-mail address or telephone number) about your visits to this Web Site and to other web sites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you. These companies may employ cookies and clear GIFs to measure advertising effectiveness. Any information that these third parties collect via cookies and clear GIFs is generally not personally identifiable (unless, for example, you provide personally identifiable information to them through an ad or e-mail message). We encourage you to read these businesses' privacy policies if you should have any concerns about how they will care for your personal information. If you would like more information about this practice and to know your choices about not having this information used by these companies, see the Network Advertising Initiative's consumer web site.</SUBTEXT>
