        <SUBTITLE>Forum &amp; comments</SUBTITLE>
        <SUBTEXT>The Eurogamer Comment System and Forum are very popular features of the site and although the team strongly believes in allowing the community that has formed around the site to grow and develop in its own way, there are a few simple rules, regulations and procedures you should be aware of when posting. Most posters will probably never run foul of these anyway, but we're quite serious about them nonetheless.

Eurogamer is not responsible for comments posted on the site by our readers. We will however attempt to remove or edit posts which are deemed to contain racist or homophobic remarks, personal abuse, libel, copyrighted material, excessive swearing, references to illegal activities and requests for CD keys or pirated software.

Obviously conversations can get heated on the forum (games are a serious business, after all), but we'd ask users to hold back from personal insults. Respond to the post, don't attack the poster.

Eurogamer staff members regularly monitor the discussion threads to ensure they stay lively, interesting, vaguely relevant and fun. However, the sheer volume of traffic on our forums and comment threads means that we don't always manage to read every post on the site. If you discover a post which you believe contravenes the site guidelines please notify a moderator with details of the page you found it on.

Users who repeatedly post inflammatory ("troll") topics or contravene the site posting guidelines will find their posts removed and eventually their user account removed. Eurogamer reserves the right to remove posting privileges from any account at any time. In general the staff will endeavour to issue warnings before a user account is removed or suspended, however, in the instance of severe transgressions, this action may be taken without any prior warning.</SUBTEXT>
