Cookies
A "cookie" is a small line of text that is stored with your Web browser for record-keeping purposes and to help us provide better service to you. Your browser has options to accept, reject, or provide you with notice when a cookie is sent. Universal Uclick may utilize "cookie" technology by sending and/or receiving information from our computers to your browser and computer. We also use cookies to customize our site(s) and deliver content specific to your interests.

Computer-Generated Information
Universal Uclick may use server logs to track your movement through our Web sites and properties - in addition, we may use this information to customize the user experience or provide registrant continuity between our various Web sites and properties.

Advertisements
The ads appearing on this Web site are delivered to you by our Web advertising partners. In the process of serving ads, advertisers place a cookie in your browser's cookie file and may use information (excluding your name, address, e-mail address or other personal information) about your visits to this and other Web sites in order to provide advertisements on this site and other Web sites about goods and services that may be of interest to you. By delivering ads on the Sites, Universal Uclick is able to record what ads a user -- identified by the unique cookie -- has seen, and what Universal Uclick site pages the user was viewing when the ads were delivered. This Web usage information is combined with other ad delivery information Universal Uclick has (e.g., what type of operating system your computer uses) collected from your visits to Universal Uclick Sites and other sites not affiliated with Universal Uclick. This non-personally identifiable information is used as part of the ad serving process for reporting and to select and direct the ads you see online at Universal Uclick Sites. Additionally, some ads are generated by third party ad serving systems that also may place a cookie on your browser to provide web usage information to those third parties. Please note that if an advertiser asks us to show an advertisement to a certain audience (for example, men ages 18-34) or audience segment (for example, men ages 13-24 who have viewed sports content) and you respond to that ad, the advertiser or ad-server may conclude that you fit the description of the audience they are trying to reach. As always remember, we only authorize our third-party ad servers to employ anonymous cookies for ad delivery and anonymous targeting. Our third-party ad servers do not collect, nor do we give them access to, any personally identifying information about you.

Opting Out of Third-Party Ad Servers
We recognize that not all users wish to receive ads targeted to their interests and we put the wishes of our users first. If you want to prevent a third-party ad server from sending and reading cookies on your computer, currently you must visit each ad network's Web site individually and opt out of this type of advertising. You may find more information from these sites:

For DoubleClick, one of our partners, cookies, and how to "opt-out," you can visit this page: http://www.doubleclick.net/us/corporate/privacy/privacy/ad-cookie/default.asp.

For 24/7 Real Media, Inc., one of our partners, cookies, and how to "opt-out," you can visit this page: http://www.247realmedia.com/privacy.html.

If you would like to opt-out of third party ad serving cookies now click here: www.networkadvertising.org/optout_nonppii.asp. This opt-out feature replaces a network advertiser's unique online preference marketing cookie on your browser with a general opt-out cookie; it does not delete cookies and does not necessarily replace other cookies placed by network advertisers, such as those that are used for aggregate ad reporting or mere ad serving purposes. Such cookies allow network advertisers to rotate ad banners sequentially and track aggregate numbers of impressions. Please see the companies' privacy policies for more details or visit the NAI web site for more information. For us at Universal Uclick, the most important thing is that you make the choice that is best for you.

        <SUBTITLE>What about kids' personally identifiable information</SUBTITLE>
        <SUBTEXT>The Universal Uclick Sites are general audience sites and are not directed to children under the age of 13. Universal Uclick assumes products purchased through credit card means are purchased by adults. Universal Uclick respects the privacy of parents and children and is committed to complying with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA). On those areas of the Sites that ask for age, Universal Uclick does not collect personal information from individuals who identify themselves as under the age of 13 except in those limited circumstances where Universal Uclick believes that such collection is permitted under COPPA.

Universal Uclick may ask prospective users to provide their age during the registration process and on other areas of the Universal Uclick Sites. If a user indicates that he or she is under the age of 13 then all personal data collected during the registration process is automatically deleted except Universal Uclick may retain and use limited information, such as the child's e-mail address, for a limited period of time, in those cases where Universal Uclick believes that the collection and use of such information is permitted under COPPA.

If a parent believes that his or her child has submitted personal information to Universal Uclick, he or she can contact us via e-mail or postal mail as listed below. Universal Uclick will promptly delete the information upon learning that it relates to a child under the age of 13.

Universal Uclick believes that parents should supervise their children's online activities and consider using parental control tools available from online services and software manufacturers that help provide a kid-friendly online environment. These tools can also prevent children from otherwise disclosing online their name, address and other personal information without parental permission.
