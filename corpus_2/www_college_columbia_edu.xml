On our secure server(s), we use industry-standard Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) technology to guarantee the confidentiality of online transactions made on our site. SSL authentication and encryption of the information that you send to us over the Internet helps protect your online transaction information from third-party interception.

We never display your sensitive information such as your full Social Security number or credit card number once it has been entered. We will only reveal the last four digits of your credit card for verification purposes.

We urge you to protect your own privacy. We recommend that you do not share any account information or passwords used to access our site(s) or service(s). We would never request from your password from you.

Although we take appropriate measures to safeguard against unauthorized disclosures of information, we cannot assure you that personally identifiable information that we collect will never be disclosed in a manner that is inconsistent with this privacy policy.

Unfortunately, despite all our efforts, there is always a risk that third parties may unlawfully intercept transmissions. This reality is true of all Internet use. As a result, we cannot ensure the security of any information you transmit, and you transmit all information at your own risk.</SUBTEXT>
