        <SUBTITLE>Will I be contacted for marketing purposes</SUBTITLE>
        <SUBTEXT>Yes. Haymarket may use the information you have provided to promote the products and services of Haymarket or others.

However, be assured that we understand the irritations of unsolicited communications and are fully committed to ensuring the rights and obligations set out in the Data Protection Act 1998 and the Privacy and Electronic Communications Regulations 2003 are respected.

If you don't want it, you won't get it. Any marketing communication you receive will always include a clear, simple option to refuse, or 'opt-out' of such future communications. You may also opt-out at ANY time by contacting us (see below).

The Telephone Preference Service (TPS) and the Mailing Preference Service (MPS) offer consumers important statutory and non-statutory protection against unsolicited marketing contact. If you are registered on either service, Haymarket will assume that your subsequent submission of personal data via a Haymarket website or data capture form indicates, for the time being, your consent to receive marketing by us. You may opt-out at ANY time by contacting us (see below).</SUBTEXT>

        <SUBTEXT>Haymarket may disclose your personal data where it believes it is compelled to do so by law; in particular for the prevention or detection of crime, the capture or prosecution of offenders; and the assessment or collection of tax or duty.

Occasionally, we may share your contact information with carefully selected third party companies whose products and services we feel may be of interest to you. We will keep these offers relevant to your interests. It's easy to unsubscribe from any email or mobile messages you no longer want. (see below).

We use a number of third party organisations to help provide a professional service to our customers (i.e. fulfilment bureaus, call centres, and website designers). These organizations act as data processors and are strictly controlled in how they may/may not use your personal data. We remain responsible for the protection of your data.

Please note that some of our partners may be located outside the European Economic Area (EEA). Countries outside the EEA may not be required to protect personal information as stringently as countries inside.</SUBTEXT>
