        <SUBTITLE>Why we collect personal information</SUBTITLE>
        <SUBTEXT>Canada Post collects personal information from you only with your knowledge and consent to help meet our commitment to provide excellent service and to continuously improve your experience on our website. The personal information we collect may include your name, email address, mailing or business address, phone numbers and language preference, but may include other information when needed to fulfill your request.
We collect this information to allow you to purchase or register for certain products, services and applications and complete those transactions; to enter contests; to subscribe to email newsletters; and to provide you with services or information that may be of interest to you.
The type of personal information we collect falls into 5 categories:
User ID and passwords:
Provides you with access to your profile and protected content.
Account information:
Tells us who you are, how to contact you, and shipping or billing information. Your account information also contains information you have provided to us, such as your language of choice, email formats and preferences.
Customer feedback and support:
Provides a mechanism for requesting information from Canada Post. This information also provides us with insight on how we may improve our products and services to meet your needs.
Email correspondence:
Used to respond to your inquiries of all kinds. With your permission, may also be used to communicate information about Canada Post and our products and services.
Transactions:
Shows us which products and services you have requested. We will not use, disclose or retain payment information (e.g. credit cards numbers) except as required under law.
To help prevent fraud and identity theft, some of our online services, such as smartmoves™, use a third-party service provider to validate your identity through an online authentication process. While you are required to provide personal information, this information is not collected by the third-party service provider and Canada Post does not have access to the personal information.

        <SUBTITLE>When do we disclose personal information</SUBTITLE>
        <SUBTEXT>Your personal information will only be used or disclosed for the specific purposes for which it is collected or as authorized by law.

        <SUBTITLE>How do we protect your personal information</SUBTITLE>
        <SUBTEXT>Canada Post uses well-established technology to protect the security of your online personal information and your personal content.
While we are committed to maintaining the security of your information, you play an important role in helping us meet this obligation. Never reveal your username, password or authentication question to anyone.
Encryption
Encryption is a way of "scrambling" electronic information for transmission. 128-bit encryption is the strongest, most secure form of encryption that is generally available in Internet browsers on the market in North America today. That's why we require all of our customers to use a browser that supports this level of encryption.
Many areas of the Canada Post website require 128-bit encryption. Your browser may use symbols such as a key or a padlock icon to show you when you are in a secure area. For more information about the encryption capabilities of your browser, use the browser's HELP menu.
In general, if your browser's encryption level is not high enough, you will not be able to use many of the Canada Post website services.
Firewalls
A firewall is an "industrial-strength" combination of hardware and software designed to separate the Internet from our internal computer systems and databases. All Internet data flows through a series of safety checkpoints on its way to and from our internal systems so that only authorized messages and transactions enter our computing environment. These firewalls also help to prevent unauthorized access to our computer systems from outside.
The Canada Post Tools and the epost™ mailbox are web-based services. This means that all your personal content and personal information are stored on our computers and viewed by you using a web browser. Many email services work by downloading messages to your computer via the Internet when you sign in. By storing your data and messages on our servers, we keep the information securely behind our firewall. Please remember, any information that moves outside our secure website may not be secure.
Viruses
A software virus is a computer file which, when installed (either from a disk or by downloading it via the Internet), can cause damage to a computer. Some viruses are relatively harmless and display annoying messages; others can seriously damage your computer and the information on it. If you choose to download files from the Internet, you should be aware of the risk of viruses.
New viruses continue to be detected on the Internet. If you choose to download any files available through links from this website, please take reasonable and appropriate precautions to scan for computer viruses.

        <SUBTITLE>How we use cookies and web analysis tools</SUBTITLE>
        <SUBTEXT>CanadaPost.ca contains links to other websites. While Canada Post takes measures to ensure that the links on our website are to reputable and well-established companies, we are not responsible for the privacy practices of those websites. We encourage you to learn about the privacy practices of those websites.
Click stream data
Click stream data includes general log information (click stream) such as the full Uniform Resource Locator (URL) of the pages you accessed on the Canada Post website and the Internet Protocol (IP) address used to connect your computer to the Internet. We collect click stream data in addition to referral and aggregated "click-through" statistics such as page views, unique visitors and time spent on the website.
Cookies
A "cookie" is a piece of data that a web server creates when you visit a website. This data is typically encoded information about how and when you use a site. It is placed on your PC in the form of a small text file. Cookies cannot carry viruses or other damaging data. For more information about cookies and why they are used, please refer to our cookies page.
Web beacons
A web beacon, also referred to as a clear gif or page tag, consists of code on the Canada Post site that delivers a small graphic image from another website or third party server. They may not be visible as the beacon is generally a 1x1 pixel that is often designed to blend into the background of a web page.
We use beacons, often in conjunction with cookies, to monitor the effectiveness of ad banners and to understand certain actions that you took (such as a purchase), but not to know who you are. We do not use beacons to store or link to personal information.
