        <SUBTITLE>INFORMATION WE COLLECT</SUBTITLE>
        <SUBTEXT>Non-Personally Identifiable Information
As part of our on-going efforts to ensure the best possible experience for all recipients of Commission Junction advertising, we may use log files, web beacons and cookies (defined below) to collect and store data from browsers, advertiser and third party sites ("Sites") to aggregate Information. The Information collected is used for marketing purposes, enables us to determine which advertisements perform well, allows us to more effectively match advertisements and website content to your interests, if necessary, assists us in improving the operation of our services, helps us to maintain the quality of our services, enhances our services to our business partners and clients and enables us to provide general statistics to our business partners and clients regarding use of Commission Junction's services.

"Log files" store tracked actions occurring on Sites and collect data including your IP address, browser type, referring url, request url, user agent, browser accept language, platform type, and date/time stamp (for clicks and sales/leads only), which make up click, impression, and sales/lead data, advertisements viewed, and any other data that comes from interaction with Commission Junction's network.

"Web beacons" are objects that are embedded in a web page or e-mail and are usually invisible to the user but are used to track a web user's navigation of a website or collection of websites or pages, interaction with an e-mail, the completion of transactions, submittal of applications and browsing behavior.

"Cookies" are files (e.g. flash browser objects or http header) that are stored on your web-enabled client (such as your web browser). There are many misconceptions about Cookies, some of which we will try to address in this policy. Cookies cannot erase your hard drive or otherwise damage your computer and do not tell us an e-mail address or any other PII. Commission Junction does not and cannot use Cookies or web beacons to retrieve PII from your computer. Cookies are used to improve the experience web users have when they see web advertisements. When a consumer responds to or views an Internet advertisement served by Commission Junction (such as through third-party Web sites or email solicitation) or visits a Commission Junction Network site, we send a Cookie and/or gif file to assign an anonymous, unique identifier to the end user's Internet browser. One function of these Cookies is to provide Commission Junction with information for the purpose of paying third-parties commissions when an Internet user clicks on a link, creates a lead, or makes a purchase on an advertiser's Web site. If the Internet user re-visits the advertiser's site directly, Commission Junction is able to continue to track the user's activities (excluding PII) on the advertiser's site and reward the third-party Web site that referred the user. We may use Cookies to estimate the total reach of an advertising campaign, as well as frequency of display. This allows advertisers to determine with greater accuracy the composition of the audience they reach. Cookies may also be used to control the delivery of a series of advertisements to a web browser, and to limit the number of times a web browser receives any one advertisement. We also may use Internet browsing and online purchase data associated with an anonymous identifier to develop a predictive statistical user profile of the end user's needs and interests. We reserve the right to retain all ad delivery and reporting data as long as may be reasonably necessary for accounting and audit purposes.

There are two classes of Cookies based on how long they remain on an internet enabled device: (i) "Session Cookies," which are used only during a web user's visit to a website or web page and are erased once such user closes the browser, and (ii) "Persistent Cookies," which remain on a web user's browser for no more than 5 years from a user's last interaction with an advertisement.

    <SECTION>
        <SUBTITLE>FOR EUROPEAN UNION AND SWISS CITIZENS.</SUBTITLE>
        <SUBTEXT>The European Union ("EU") maintains strict privacy laws. These rules differ significantly from the laws of the United States of America ("U.S."). To reconcile these differences, the U.S and the EU have created a safe harbor that defines mutually acceptable privacy operations ("U.S.-EU Safe Harbor Framework"). The U.S. and Switzerland have created a similar safe harbor (“U.S.-Swiss Safe Harbor Framework”). For more information see www.export.gov/safeharbor.

Commission Junction complies with the U.S.-EU and U.S.-Swiss Safe Harbor Frameworks as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal information from European Union member countries and Switzerland. We have certified that we adhere to the Safe Harbor Privacy Principles of notice, choice, onward transfer, security, data integrity, access, and enforcement. To learn more about the Safe Harbor program, and to view the company's certification, please visit http://www.export.gov/safeharbor.

In compliance with the U.S.-EU and U.S.-Swiss Safe Harbor Privacy Principles, Commission Junction, Inc. commits to resolve complaints about your privacy and our collection or use of your personal information. European Union or Swiss citizens with inquiries or complaints regarding this privacy policy should first contact Commission Junction, Inc. at cjprivacy@cj.com.

Commission Junction, Inc. has further committed to refer unresolved privacy complaints under the U.S.-EU and U.S.-Swiss Safe Harbor Privacy Principles to an independent dispute resolution mechanism, the BBB EU SAFE HARBOR, operated by the Council of Better Business Bureaus. If you do not receive timely acknowledgment of your complaint, or if your complaint is not satisfactorily addressed by Commission Junction, Inc. please visit the BBB EU SAFE HARBOR website at www.bbb.org/us/safe-harbor-complaints for more information and to file a complaint.
