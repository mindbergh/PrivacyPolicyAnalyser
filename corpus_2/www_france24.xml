Cookies
What is a cookie?
When a user enters a site, the site can automatically send a cookie to the user's computer. These are small files containing text which enable a server to recognize a computer and thus to know whether the computer (and probably the user) has already visited the site. If the computer reconnects to the site, the site will look for and use any cookies that have been left on that computer's hard disk.

The cookies themselves do not enable a user to be identified, but only the computer used by that user.</SUBTEXT>

    <SECTION>
        <SUBTITLE>Cookies</SUBTITLE>
        <SUBTEXT>Cookies merely record the parts of the site that the computer in question has visited, and the amount of time spent there.

Users can decline to accept cookies by configuring their browser in the way described below; however, if cookies are refused, it will be impossible for the user to use certain personalized services, and such refusal may slow down or prevent access to certain parts of the Site.</SUBTEXT>

        <SUBTITLE>Applicable law - Independence of Clauses</SUBTITLE>
        <SUBTEXT>These Conditions of Use will be subject to and interpreted in accordance with French law. Any dispute which cannot be resolved by agreement will be referred to the courts of Nanterre. In the event that any of the provisions of the Conditions of Use is held to be null or void, the remaining provisions will automatically be deemed to apply.

Failure by France 24 to apply, or to claim the application of, any of the provisions of the Conditions of Use or of any right of any kind shall not in any circumstances be interpreted as a waiver of that provision or that right on the part of France 24, unless France 24 agrees otherwise in writ</SUBTEXT>
