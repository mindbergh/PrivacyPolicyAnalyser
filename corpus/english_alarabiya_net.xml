        <SUBTEXT>By accessing and making use of the services offered by Al Arabiya News (‘Al Arabiya') and/or the digital properties of Al Arabiya, you consent to our collection and use of your personal information as described in this Privacy Policy.
Al Arabiya is committed to the protection of the privacy of the users of its services. This Privacy Policy explains how Al Arabiya deals with your personal information, including:

What information we collect from you and why we collect it.
How we use that information.
The choices we offer you with respect to your personal information, including how to access and update that information.</SUBTEXT>

        <SUBTITLE>INFORMATION WE COLLECT</SUBTITLE>
        <SUBTEXT>We collect information to provide better services to all of our users. Knowing something about you helps us give you more of what you want – more shows, more exclusives, more information, more competitions and a better user experience. It also helps us to figure out more complex things like which advertisements you'll find most useful or services and information that are most relevant to you, thereby giving a much better and more useful experience of our digital properties.</SUBTEXT>

    <SECTION>
        <SUBTITLE>We collect information in two ways</SUBTITLE>
        <SUBTEXT>Information you give us. We collect personal information from users as and when provided to us through the use of online forms, surveys and every time you email us your details. Additionally, some of our services may require you to sign in to take advantage of certain features. In other instances, we may invite you to sign up for certain services, such as newsletters, or information feeds (e.g. SMS updates). When you do, we'll ask for personal information, like your name, email address, or telephone number. If you want to take full advantage of the sharing features that we offer (e.g. participation in viewer forums and discussion boards, engagement with second-screen co-viewing apps), we may also ask you to create a publicly visible profile, which may – if you choose - include your name and photo.


Information we get from your use of our services. We also collect additional information automatically about your visit to our digital properties. We use cookies to identify you when you visit our digital properties, to follow your browsing patterns and build up your demographic profile. A cookie is a small piece of information sent by a web server to a web browser, which enables the server to collect information from the browser. Most browsers allow you to turn off cookies. If you want to know how to do this please look at the help menu on your browser. However, some cookies are essential for us to use in order to provide you with the services you have requested and switching off cookies will restrict your use of our digital properties.</SUBTEXT>

    <SECTION>
        <SUBTITLE>How we use your data</SUBTITLE>
        <SUBTEXT>We process personal information collected from you and our digital properties for the purposes of providing you with the services you request from us, as well as maintaining and improving the services we provide to you, and developing new ones. We also use the information to conduct market research and to provide you with tailored content – such as relevant advertisements and services.
When you contact Al Arabiya, we may keep a record of your communication to help solve any issues you might be facing. We may use your contact details to send you direct marketing, including to inform you about our services, such as letting you know about upcoming program information or improvements to our digital properties.
We also use information we collect from cookies to improve your user experience and the overall quality of our services.
We may combine personal information from one service with information, including personal information, from other Al Arabiya services – for example to make it easier to share things with people you know.
We will not combine advertising server cookie information with personally identifiable information unless we have your opt-in consent to do so.
Al Arabiya processes personal information on our servers, which might reside in a number of countries around the world. We may process your personal information on a server located outside the country where you live and for this purpose transfer your personal information out of your country of residence.
We will ask for your consent before using information for a purpose other than those that are set out in this Privacy Policy.</SUBTEXT>
    </SECTION>
    <SECTION>
        <SUBTITLE>Information we share</SUBTITLE>
        <SUBTEXT>We will only disclose personal information to members of Al Arabiya and its mother company, successors in title to our business and suppliers we engage to process data on our behalf. Otherwise, we will never share any personal information collected from you with other companies, organizations and individuals unless:

It is done with your consent: We will share personal information with companies, organizations or individuals outside of Al Arabiya when we have your consent to do so, including for external processing where we provide personal information to our affiliates or other trusted businesses or persons to process it for us, based on our instructions and in compliance with our Privacy Policy and other appropriate confidentiality and security measures.
It is for legal reasons: We will share personal information with companies, organizations or individuals outside of Al Arabiya if we have a good-faith belief that access, use, preservation or disclosure of the information is reasonably necessary to:
Meet the requirements of any applicable law, regulation, legal process or enforceable governmental request.
Enforce applicable Terms of Service, including investigation of potential violations.
Detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues.
Protect against harm to the rights, property or safety of Al Arabiya, our users or the public as required or permitted by law.

We may share aggregated, non-personally identifiable information publicly and with our partners – like advertisers or connected sites. For example, we may share information publicly to show trends about the general use of our services.</SUBTEXT>
    </SECTION>
    <SECTION>
        <SUBTITLE>Information security</SUBTITLE>
        <SUBTEXT>We do our best to protect Al Arabiya and our users from unauthorized access, use, alteration, disclosure or destruction of information we hold. In particular:

We review our information collection, storage and processing practices, including physical security measures, from time to time to guard against unauthorized access to systems.
We restrict access to personal information to authorized Al Arabiya employees, contractors and agents who need to know that information in order to process it for us, and who are subject to strict contractual confidentiality obligations and may be disciplined or terminated if they fail to meet these obligations.</SUBTEXT>
    </SECTION>
    <SECTION>
        <SUBTITLE>Accessing and updating your personal information</SUBTITLE>
        <SUBTEXT>We will give you ways to update, or delete your personal information - unless we have to keep that information for legitimate business or legal purposes. When updating your personal information, we may ask you to verify your identity before we can act on your request.
We may reject requests that are unreasonably repetitive, require disproportionate technical effort (for example, developing a new system or fundamentally changing an existing practice), risk the privacy of others, or would be extremely impractical (for instance, requests concerning information residing on backup tapes).
We aim to maintain our services in a manner that protects information from accidental or malicious destruction. Because of this, after you delete information from our services, we may not immediately delete residual copies from our active servers and may not remove information from our backup systems.</SUBTEXT>
    </SECTION>
    <SECTION>
        <SUBTITLE>Application</SUBTITLE>
        <SUBTEXT>This Privacy Policy applies to all the services offered by Al Arabiya, its mother company, and its affiliates, including services offered on other digital properties (e.g. our news services), but excludes services that have separate privacy policies that do not incorporate this Privacy Policy.
Our digital properties may contain links to other websites which are outside our control and are not covered by this Privacy Policy. If you access other sites using the links provided, the operators of these sites may collect information from you which will be used by them in accordance with their privacy policies, which may differ from ours.</SUBTEXT>

        <SUBTITLE>Enforcement</SUBTITLE>
        <SUBTEXT>We regularly review our compliance with our Privacy Policy.</SUBTEXT>
