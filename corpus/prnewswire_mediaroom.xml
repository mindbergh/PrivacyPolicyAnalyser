        <SUBTEXT>PR Newswire Privacy Policy

Effective April 18, 2011


Welcome to our website, prnewswire.com.

PR Newswire Association LLC (“PR Newswire” or “we”) is the global leader in news and information distribution services for professional communicators. This privacy policy explains how we collect, use, and protect information about you, an individual person, as you

·         visit the public pages available through this website, http://prnewswire.com, or register for one of its personalized services;

·         visit pages related to the iReach™ service, https://ireach.prnewswire.com, or order services available through those web pages;

·         visit the web pages of or register for Investor Uprising, www.investoruprising.com;

·         access restricted areas available only to members or journalists, including:

o    PR Newswire for Journalists (http://media.prnewswire.com/en/jsp/main.jsp),

o    ProfNet (https://profnet.prnewswire.com/),

o    Online Member Center (https://portal.prnewswire.com/),

o    MultiVu (http://www.multivu.com/),

o    eWatch or PR Newswire Media Monitoring services,

o    MEDIAtlas (http://mediatlas.prnewswire.com/mediatlas/Login.aspx?LanguageID=1033&amp;RedirectLink),

o    Vintage Filings (http://www.vfilings.com/), and

Certain services and pages listed above may be available via mobile app. This privacy policy governs the collection and use of data about you and your use of any PRN mobile app.  We may provide additional notice and choice options within the app itself.

This policy does not, however, cover the websites for Virtual Press Office (VPO), Notilog, Hispanic PR Wire, Hispanic Digital Network, or the websites listed under “Global Sites” on the top right hand side of the prnewswire.com home page.

News and journalism are public activities. Your name, business contact details, and professional interests and affiliations may already be publicly available, particularly if you are a journalist, a recognized expert, or a PR professional.   We have created this privacy policy because we recognize that even in a business context you may have a need and expectation that your identity and interests be kept anonymous or private in certain circumstances. We want to be clear about when and how we protect that expectation.</SUBTEXT>

        <SUBTITLE>Information We Collect About You</SUBTITLE>
        <SUBTEXT>You may visit a number of pages throughout the website without registration. We collect the information you, or the member company you represent, give us:


·         When you register.

·         When a member company authorizes you to manage its account or use our web-based services on its behalf.

·         On occasion, for example, for the experts listed in ProfNet, we may combine data collected from other sources and add it to the information you or the member company has provided.

·         We may also compile your contact data from other sources to contact you if we think you or the company you represent would be interested in our products and services.

·         When you order services.

Automatic Data Collection Technologies.  A cookie is a small file of information which is placed on your browser. That cookie then communicates with servers, ours or those of other companies that we authorize to collect data for us, and allows recognition of your personal computer. We associate a cookie with information that identifies you as an individual if you use the automatic recognition capabilities on restricted areas, order a service, use the personalization services available as part of prnewswire.com, or ask us to contact you with additional marketing information.

We also include cookies in our ARC™ videoplayer to count the number of unique viewers who see a customer's video press release and to provide aggregate reporting.  The cookies do not identify you as an individual or track your online behavior.


Our log servers collect standard web information about visits and system capabilities as you access and use the web pages covered by this policy.


We may use the resulting information in ways described below.</SUBTEXT>

    <SECTION>
        <SUBTITLE>How We Use Information About You</SUBTITLE>
        <SUBTEXT>How we use information about you depends upon the capacity in which you visit our sites. For example, if you simply visit our pages for news and do not register, we will not know who you are and will not collect information that identifies you. But if you are using the member-only areas to represent a member company or to order a service, we may note how the service is being used.

We may use the information about you in any of the following ways:

·         To provide the services you or the member company you represent requests.

·         To provide information you request.

·         To evaluate and improve our websites and services.

·         To contact you directly about your use of an account or service for which you are registered.

·         To let you know about offerings, from us or from third parties, that may be of interest to you.

·         To create reports for member companies and customers that may include both aggregate trends and the media organizations that are viewing their releases.

·         To protect the integrity of our services and secured areas of our sites.

·         For any other purpose we tell you about when you submit information to us.</SUBTEXT>

If you choose to disable the cookies that support automatic recognition, you will need to re-enter your user ID and password each time you access a gated portion of the website.


Third party cookies and ad servers.  We may ask or authorize third parties to serve cookies on our web sites or pages and include web beacons in email marketing campaigns.  These cookies and web beacons may be used to track your responses and your interests in our content, offerings and web pages.  You may use the controls in your browser to disable the tracking functions or these cookie-based technologies.
