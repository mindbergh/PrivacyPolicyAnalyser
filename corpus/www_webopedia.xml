In some cases, we may collect information, such as your age, weight, health conditions, insurance type, and whether you're a non-smoker, combined with your Personal Information. We will treat all such information as Personal Information as long as it is combined with Personal Information.

We collect Personal Information when you interact with us on the Site. We may associate Personal Information you provide through the Site with Personal Information collected from other sources. We will use the combined information in accordance with this Privacy Policy as long as it is combined.
