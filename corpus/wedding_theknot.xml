        <SUBTITLE>How We Collect Your Information</SUBTITLE>
        <SUBTEXT>The first thing to remember about privacy is that there is only so much information that any website can collect without your answering of specific questions. The Knot logs IP addresses (in other words, the location of your computer on the Internet) for system administration, troubleshooting, and to examine overall traffic trends. (For example, IP addresses help us determine the percentage of people coming from various online gateways, such as Yahoo! or America Online.) This information, in aggregate form, is recorded for administrative purposes only. IP addresses are not linked to any personal information.
The Knot uses a cookie, a small data file stored on your computer, to customize portions of our site to your preferences. For example, The Knot uses a cookie to identify you as a Knot member and to make sure that only you have access to, for example, your own personal wedding budget and calendar. This way, you answer certain questions only once and not every time you participate in an activity or event. The cookie by itself doesn't tell us, or anyone else, who you are, what your email address is, or anything else personal. You provide that information when you register with The Knot, and only The Knot has access to that information. If you choose set up your browser to reject all cookies, please understand that you may be limited to some the areas or functionality within our site.For more information on cookies, please see our Cookie FAQ.
You can browse The Knot and read our editorial content without registering or providing any personal information. However, in order to take advantage of our personalized services, you are required to provide us with information such as your name, email address, real-world address, wedding date, and role in the wedding. We collect similar information from users who choose to participate in our contests and promotional events. We always let you know before we collect any personal information from you.
We offer message boards, personal web pages, chat rooms and blogs on our website. Any information you voluntarily disclose when you post to one of these areas becomes public and may be used by us for online and offline promotional and commercial uses. If you choose to post comments on our website, you should be aware that any personally identifiable information you submit is public and can be read, collected, or used by other users of those areas, and could be used to send you unsolicited messages. We are not responsible for any personally identifiable information you choose to submit.
If you choose to use our "Send to a Friend" feature, which allows you to send an e-mail message to specified addresses and which contains a link to an article on our website that you think may be of interest to your friend(s), we will ask you for the e-mail address(es) that the message should be sent to. We will automatically send a one-time e-mail inviting the recipient(s) to read the article. We store this information for the sole purpose of sending this one-time email and tracking the success of our "Send to a Friend" feature. In some instances, third-party sponsorships and promotions on our site offer similar functionality, and in those cases, the information is not shared with the third party. Your friend may contact us at membersupport@theknot.com to request that we remove this information from our database.</SUBTEXT>

        <SUBTITLE>Other Sites</SUBTITLE>
        <SUBTEXT>The Knot contains links to other websites. We cannot be responsible for their content or for private information that you may choose to share with them. Please note: Information you release directly to parties who provide services to The Knot, such as any vendors in The Knot Shop or other sites you encounter on the Internet (even sites that are co-branded with The Knot) may be subject to different rules of use or disclosure.

        <SUBTITLE>Our Security Procedures</SUBTITLE>
        <SUBTEXT>Your privacy is very important to us, but due to the existing legal regulatory and security environment, we cannot fully ensure that your private communications and other personally identifiable information will not be disclosed to third parties. Under certain circumstances, the government or third parties may unlawfully intercept or access transmissions or private communications. Additionally, in the unlikely event we need to investigate or resolve possible problems or inquiries, we can disclose any information about you to private entities, law enforcement, or other government officials as we, in our sole discretion, believe necessary or appropriate.
Finally, we use industry standard efforts to safeguard the confidentiality of your personal identifiable information, such as firewalls and Secure Socket Layers (SSL) where appropriate. We also do everything in our power to protect user-information off-line. All of our users' information, not just the sensitive information mentioned above, is restricted in our offices. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job (for example, a Member Services representative) are granted access to personally identifiable information. Our employees must use password-protected screen-savers when they leave their desk. When they return, they must re-enter their password to re-gain access to your information. Furthermore, ALL employees are kept up-to-date on our security and privacy practices. Every quarter, as well as any time new policies are added, our employees are notified and/or reminded about the importance we place on privacy, and what they can do to ensure our customers' information is protected. Finally, the servers that we store personally identifiable information on are kept in a secure environment, behind a locked cage requiring keys, photo ID key cards and biometric scans to access.
We hope this policy clarifies our procedures regarding your personal information. If you have any questions about the security at our website, you can send an email security@theknot.com.</SUBTEXT>

        <SUBTITLE>Notice of Changes</SUBTITLE>

At the time of this message, you will be able to opt-out of this information usage by sending a message to membersupport@theknot.com. We will also post the changes in our privacy statement 30 days prior to a change. You should also check this posted privacy statement for changes.
