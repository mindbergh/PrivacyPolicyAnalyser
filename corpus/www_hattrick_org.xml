        <SUBTEXT>Privacy statement

Hattrick Ltd, a company with its registered address at Suites 41/42, Victoria House, 26 Main Street, Gibraltar, publisher of Hattrick.org, has created this privacy statement in order to demonstrate our firm commitment to privacy. The following discloses the information gathering and dissemination practices for this Web site.

Hattrick has under the Gibraltar Data Protection Ordinance of 2004 registered as Data Controller with the Gibraltar Data Protection Commissioner (http://www.gra.gi/index.php?site=dataprotection).

Hattrick processes the data itself and is the legal entity responsible for processing the data. Further, Hattrick's Game Masters, as a part of administering and supervising the games, act as Hattrick's data assistants and process the data, within and outside the EEA area. The game masters have entered into confidentiality agreements with Hattrick to protect your privacy. Since the game masters act as data processors the game masters have no independent responsibility for the processing but all such responsibility is borne by Hattrick Ltd.</SUBTEXT>

        <SUBTITLE>Cookies</SUBTITLE>
        <SUBTEXT>We do not use cookies to extract information from you, solely to simplify your visits, mainly by having cookies remember which language and specific part of the site you want to start your visit with, or to remember last login date so that we can distinguish new users from returning ones. A temporary cookie is also used to keep track of your "session". Without that temporary cookie (which is not stored after you quit your browser) you would have had to log on again on each page. You can turn off cookies in your web browser (more information about this is available at http://www.aboutcookies.org/). This will however make it more or less impossible to access many of the functions on our web site. When you follow links from Hattrick to other web sites, these may install tracking cookies on your computer. This is beyond the control of Hattrick.</SUBTEXT>

The customer's e-mail address is used to send an e-mail verification message, Hattrick newsletters (this can be opted out from), password reminders upon request, inactivity reminders, subscription expiration reminders, order confirmations, information about changes in the terms of use and very seldomly information about new features to users with deleted accounts.
