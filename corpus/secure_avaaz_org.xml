        <SUBTITLE>Introduction</SUBTITLE>
        <SUBTEXT>This website, avaaz.org (along with all translated versions of which hereafter referred to as the “Site”) is operated by Avaaz (“We” or “Us”). Avaaz is the operating name of the “Avaaz Foundation,” a non-profit organization incorporated in the State of Delaware.

Avaaz is committed to protecting your privacy online. We're members too, and we treat your privacy as we do our own. We wrote this privacy policy to let you know how we treat your personal information – and to show you all the ways we work hard to keep it safe and private.

Please read the following carefully to understand our policies and practices regarding your personal information and how we will treat it. By using or accessing our Website, you agree to this privacy policy. This policy applies only to information collected through this website (Avaaz.org) and does not apply to information collected on any affiliated site or third-party site or by any third-party application that may link to or be accessible from this Website, nor does it apply to any offline contact between you and Avaaz. This policy may change from time to time (see Changes to the Privacy Policy) and your continued use of the Website is deemed to be acceptance of such changes, so please check the policy periodically for updates.

Avaaz will send you updates by e-mail. If at any time you would like to unsubscribe from our email list, you may do so by contacting complaints@avaaz.org with the subject heading “unsubscribe.”</SUBTEXT>

        <SUBTITLE>Your Personal Information</SUBTITLE>
        <SUBTEXT>In addition to the information you provide us, we collect certain additional information to help us improve our campaigns and to otherwise better serve our collective mission to close the gap between the world we have and the world most people everywhere want. We collect and use the following information:
Information that you provide by filling in forms on our Website or participating online in our campaigns. This includes information provided at the time of registering as a member, signing petitions, sending messages through our site to campaign targets or others, or otherwise filling out forms on the Avaaz website. We may also ask you for information when you report a problem with our Website.
Records and copies of your correspondence (including e-mail addresses), if you contact us.
Your responses to surveys that we might ask you to complete for research purposes or to help direct our campaigns and activities, although you do not have to respond to them.
Details of transactions you carry out through our Website if you are one of our members who generously support Avaaz financially and the work we do together.
Certain information about usage of the Avaaz site, described below in the section on Data Tracking.
Where from the world you hail and whether you tell others about Avaaz campaigns.
We do not share the information you've given us with unaffiliated groups without your explicit permission. We may share some of your personal information with certain affiliated groups. For example: Affiliated Third Parties and contractors – such as our database administrators – for the sole purpose of helping us do our work. These groups do not share your personal information or use it for any purpose other than as instructed by us.

Third Party Administrators, such as organizations we engage to facilitate large distribution of messages. The content of these emails will be from Avaaz and these third parties do not have direct access to your personally identifiable information.

In addition, with your explicit permission, we pass along certain of your information to the following groups (as is standard practice):
World leaders, news publications and other targets when you choose to use our email tool to send them messages.
World leaders, news publications, and the general public when you sign petitions or complete surveys.
Further information about how we use personal information in connection with particular types of campaigns is discussed below.</SUBTEXT>

        <SUBTITLE>Petitions and Surveys</SUBTITLE>
        <SUBTEXT>For petitions and surveys you've signed or completed, we treat your name, city, state, and comments as public information—for example, we may provide compilations of petitions, with your comments, to world leaders and other targets, or to the press. We will not make your street address publicly available, but we may transmit it to the designated target as part of a petition. This is a standard industry practice in such situations. In no such case will we disclose your email address or phone number, without your permission. We may also make your comments, along with your first name, city and state available to the press and public online. When you do give permission for us to share your email address as part of a campaign, Avaaz is not responsible for the content or use of your email address by campaign targets.</SUBTEXT>

    <SECTION>
        <SUBTITLE>Sending Emails Via Avaaz</SUBTITLE>
        <SUBTEXT>In certain cases, we enable you to send individual e-mails to world leaders or other targets as well as Letters-to-the-Editor to various news publications, through our website. These messages are sent in your name, with your e-mail address as the return address and your full name and contact information is provided as part of the submission. These messages will only be sent out under your name as you approve them on an individual basis using our email tool. You are solely responsible for the specific message(s) you send using our email tool. Avaaz takes no responsibility for the content or use of your email address by campaign targets.</SUBTEXT>

    <SECTION>
        <SUBTITLE>Financial Donations</SUBTITLE>
        <SUBTEXT>If you choose to make a donation to Avaaz, your credit card information will be used only for this transaction through our secure online payment system. Avaaz does not retain credit card information.</SUBTEXT>

        <SUBTITLE>Phone Campaigns</SUBTITLE>
        <SUBTEXT>From time to time, the Avaaz staff members or Avaaz volunteers may contact you by telephone about urgent campaigns. If you have provided your telephone number to us through our website then you may be contacted by one of our volunteers or staff members (each of whom are bound by the terms of the Avaaz privacy policy and will not use your personal information for any other purpose). If you would like to be removed permanently from our phone list, please email us at info@avaaz.org with the subject line "UNSUBSCRIBE PHONE NUMBER". Please allow 8-10 business days for your information to be removed.</SUBTEXT>

    <SECTION>
        <SUBTITLE>Member-Initiated Petitions</SUBTITLE>
        <SUBTEXT>Avaaz enables its members to develop and run their own campaigns on our member-initiated petition site. Avaaz members run these campaigns under their own name and send them to friends, family and others to build a movement. If these petitions demonstrate the ability to generate significant support, Avaaz may send the petition on behalf of the whole Avaaz community to larger segments of our membership. When doing so, Avaaz may use the information the member who initiated the campaign has provided and may edit or modify it within our sole discretion. While members will bear primary responsibility for delivering their petitions to the petition targets, Avaaz also may choose to deliver member-initiated petitions to their targets in some instances.

When people sign on to support Avaaz members' campaigns, Avaaz collects the information those signers provide in order to send those new participants information about future campaigns and otherwise to further the Avaaz mission. Those new participants can always choose to remain Avaaz members or to decline. Avaaz may also provide the emails of people who sign a member-initiated campaign to the member who initiated the campaign so that member can continue that campaign's efforts. Whenever we do this, we will require that the member who initiated the campaign give signers an ability to opt-out of further emails from that member as a condition to receiving the emails of people who have signed that campaign. When members initiate their own campaigns, Avaaz may send thank you notes and other correspondence to people who participate in those campaigns on behalf of the Avaaz member who initiated the campaign or on behalf of Avaaz.</SUBTEXT>

        <SUBTITLE>Data Security</SUBTITLE>
        <SUBTEXT>When you give Avaaz personal information, we take steps to ensure that your information is treated securely. Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we strive to protect your personal information, Avaaz cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us, and you do so at your own risk. Once we receive your transmission, we make our best effort to ensure its security on our systems. The safety and security of your information also depends on you. Where we have given you (or where you have chosen) a password for access to certain parts of our Website, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential. We ask you not to share your password with anyone.

Under circumstances where we determine that members may be misusing our systems for malicious purposes (for example, using the numbers we provide to make harassing phone calls), such activities may be reported to law enforcement agencies. In such cases, Avaaz may release personally identifiable information, including name and address, to those agencies.</SUBTEXT>

Visitors who are under 13 years of age should ask their parent or legal guardian for assistance when using the Site and should not submit any personally identifying information to the Site.

        <SUBTITLE>Cookies</SUBTITLE>
        <SUBTEXT>Some parts of the Site are password-protected. We will use a cookie (cookies reside on your computer and are under the control of your browser) to enable you to return to password-protected areas of the website without having to re-enter your password or to otherwise optimize your experience on the site by, for example, tracking the type of webmail you are using to maximize the site's compatibility with your system. We also may use cookies to track data without identifying specific users as described below.

        <SUBTITLE>Data Tracking</SUBTITLE>
        <SUBTEXT>In order to better serve our members, in addition to collecting the information listed above, we also use cookies and other tools such as Google Analytics, Chartbeat, Litmus and similar services to analyze web activity. These services provide us with statistical data that does not identify any individual. This helps us understand traffic patterns and know if there are problems with our website. We may also use embedded images in emails to track open rates for our mailings, so that we can tell which mailings appeal most to Avaaz members. We also may collect IP addresses or other data about visits to our website to better understand where our traffic is coming from, how our services are being accessed, and to provide customized services to members.

URLs contained in emails may contain an ID that enables us to correctly identify the person who takes an action using a web page. We use these URLs to simplify the process of signing petitions and filling out surveys. We may occasionally present a shortened URL that references a longer URL which contains an id—we do this to simplify the display, to prevent links from becoming broken when copied, and to ensure compatibility with email programs which do not handle long URLs. When a shortened URL is displayed in an email, you will see the full URL in the browser's address bar when you access the page.</SUBTEXT>
