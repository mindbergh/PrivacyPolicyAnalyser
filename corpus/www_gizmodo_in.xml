Comments - In order to enhance their use of the Site users can choose to leave comments on particular articles of interest. Commenters may register anonymously. However, if a third party complains that a comment breaches our Terms of Service (e.g. libels them), then in accordance with our Terms of Service, we will make reasonable efforts to contact the commenter and alert them to the situation. If we are required to by law to disclose commenters' contact information, we will attempt to contact commenters to give them the opportunity to respond to such requests. Please refer to our Terms of Service for more information.

Mailing Lists &amp; Service Emails - The Site may launch a mailing list, in order to provide subscribers with relevant information - breaking news, or weekly or daily round-ups, for example. In order to sign up to receive regular emails from a site's mailing list, users must submit information including a valid email address and demographic information such as location and interests. This information will be used in aggregate form only in order to assess general user interest in various internal and third party products and services, and your personal and contact information will not be passed to any other organization. Users who choose to sign up for a mailing list will receive regular emails from the site. The Site may from time to time track user email usage in a continued effort to improve our services. Most of the time, these will be content from the site in question, but we may occasionally send out an email from a third party sponsor. This will be infrequent, and does not represent an endorsement by the Site of any products advertised therein. It will clearly be marked as advertising. Since editorial independence is critical to us, you can be sure that we will never send out a sponsored email in the guise of a glowing product review. If you do not wish to receive emails from third party advertisers, please do not sign up for the mailing list.

Comment Service and Cookies - In order to further enhance the user experience, the Site runs a comment service on some or all these sites where users can discuss common topics of interest. Users have the option of signing up for this service, and to do so must submit some valid information.

The Site will not pass this information to any other organization except in aggregate form. The Comment Service may use cookies.
