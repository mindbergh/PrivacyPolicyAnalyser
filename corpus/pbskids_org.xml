        <SUBTITLE>Use of Cookies, Web Beacons, and Other Technologies</SUBTITLE>
        <SUBTEXT>We may use cookies, web beacons, Local Shared Objects, and other similar technologies to collect information about your or your child's use of the Services. Cookies are small bits of information that are stored by a computer's web browser. Web beacons are very small images or small pieces of data embedded in images, also known as "pixel tags," "GIFs," or "clear GIFs," that can recognize cookies, the time and date a page is viewed, a description of the page where the pixel tag is placed, and similar information from a computer or device. Local Shared Objects (sometimes referred to as "Flash Cookies") are similar to standard cookies except that they can be larger and are downloaded to a computer or mobile device by the Adobe Flash media player.

We use these technologies, for example, to help us recognize your or your child's browser as a previous user and save and remember any preferences that may have been set; to help us customize the content shown while you or your child use the Services; to provide you or your child with content customized to your interests and to understand whether users read e-mail messages and click on links contained within those messages so that we can deliver relevant content and offers; and to help measure and research the effectiveness of our Services, interactive online content, features, and other communications.

We may allow third parties to place and read their own cookies, web beacons, and similar technologies to collect information through the Services. For example, our third-party service providers may use these technologies to collect information that helps us with traffic measurement, research, and analytics.

You may be able to refuse or disable cookies by adjusting your web browser settings. Because each web browser is different, please consult the instructions provided by your web browser (typically in the "help" section). Please note that you may need to take additional steps to refuse or disable Local Shared Objects and similar technologies. For example, Local Shared Objects may be controlled through the instructions on Adobe's Setting Manager page. If you choose to refuse, disable, or delete these technologies, some of the functionality of our site may no longer be available to you or your child.</SUBTEXT>

Parents or legal guardians may contact us to ask if we have collected their child's personal account information, to review that information, if any, and request that PBS stop collecting this information and have it deleted. Such requests are subject to PBS verifying to our satisfaction that the requester is in fact the child's parent or legal guardian.</SUBTEXT>

When you watch third-party content that is made available through the Services or navigate to such third-party sites, you become subject to the third party's terms of use and privacy policies.
