        <SUBTITLE>Web Beacons</SUBTITLE>
        <SUBTEXT>In limited circumstances we also may use tiny graphic image files imbedded in a web page or email that provide a presence on the web page or email and send back to its home server information from the user's browser (“Web Beacons”) to collect anonymous, non-personal information about your use of our Services and the sites of selected sponsors and advertisers, and your use of emails, special promotions or newsletters we send to you.

        <SUBTITLE>Website Analytics</SUBTITLE>
        <SUBTEXT>We may use third party website analytics services in connection with the Services, for example, to record mouse clicks, mouse movements, scrolling activity, as well as any text that you type into the Site.

    </SECTION>
    <SECTION>
        <SUBTITLE>Storage</SUBTITLE>
        <SUBTEXT>We store all Traffic Data and review postings indefinitely, even after “deletion,” and may archive such information elsewhere.

    <SECTION>
        <SUBTITLE>Information Provided on Behalf of Children</SUBTITLE>
        <SUBTEXT>ZocDoc does not collect information from children under the age of 13 in accordance with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (“COPPA”) as discussed below. If you are a parent or legal guardian of a minor child, you may, in compliance with the Terms of Use, use the Services on behalf of such minor child. Any information that you provide us while using the Services on behalf of your minor child will be treated as Personal Information as otherwise provided herein.</SUBTEXT>
    </SECTION>
    <SECTION>
        <SUBTITLE>Children's Online Privacy Protection Act</SUBTITLE>
        <SUBTEXT>COPPA severely restricts what information can be collected from children under the age of 13. For this reason, children under the age of 13 in the United States are prohibited from using the Services. The Services are not directed at children, and ZocDoc does not knowingly collect any information from individuals under the age of 13. If we learn that we have received any information from an individual under the age of 13, we will use that information only to respond directly to that child (or a parent or legal guardian) to inform him or her that he or she cannot use the Services and subsequently we will delete that information from our own servers.</SUBTEXT>
    </SECTION>
    <SECTION>
        <SUBTITLE>ZocDoc's Use of Your Information</SUBTITLE>
        <SUBTEXT>We may use your Personal Information to recommend certain resources or Providers. We may use your contact data to send you information about ZocDoc or our products or Services, to contact you when necessary, including to remind you of upcoming or follow-up appointments, and in conjunction with your use of certain Interactive Tools. We may use your demographic data, Traffic Data, insurance data or medical data to customize and tailor your experience through the Services, in emails and in other communications, displaying content that we think you might be interested in and according to your preferences. Use of the Services may require ZocDoc to use your Personal Information to allow your Providers to refer you to, and make appointments with, other Providers on your behalf. We may also use your anonymized Personal Information to run (or authorize third parties to run) statistical research on individual or aggregate health or medical trends. Such research would only use your Personal Information in an anonymous manner that cannot be tied directly back to you.</SUBTEXT>

    <SECTION>

        <SUBTEXT>We share certain categories of information we collect from you in the ways described in this Privacy Policy, including as described below:

We share Personal Information and Traffic Data with our business partners who assist us by performing core services (such as hosting, billing, fulfillment, or data storage and security) related to our operation of the Services and/or by making certain Interactive Tools available to our users. Those business partners shall be bound to uphold the same standards of security and confidentiality that we have promised to you in this Privacy Policy, and they will only use your contact data and other Personal Information to carry out their specific business obligations to ZocDoc and to provide your requested medical care and services.
We may share your contact data with our subcontractors to enable them to send you ZocDoc promotional materials. These subcontractors will only use your contact data to send you ZocDoc promotional materials.

    <SECTION>
        <SUBTITLE>User Choice</SUBTITLE>

    </SECTION>
    <SECTION>
        <SUBTITLE>Doctors and Dentists</SUBTITLE>
        <SUBTEXT>Doctors, dentists, their employees, and their agents should be particularly aware of their obligations of patient confidentiality, including without limitation their obligations under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (“HIPAA”), both in communicating with ZocDoc and in responding to a review of their services posted on our Site. ZocDoc does not have, and will not accept, any obligations of confidentiality with respect to any communications other than those expressly stated in this Privacy Policy and ZocDoc's Terms of Use.</SUBTEXT>
    </SECTION>
    <SECTION>
        <SUBTITLE>Public Information</SUBTITLE>
        <SUBTEXT>Any information that you may reveal in a review posting or other online discussion or forum is intentionally open to the public and is not in any way private. You should think carefully before disclosing any personally identifiable information in any public forum. What you have written may be seen and/or collected by third parties and may be used by others in ways we are unable to control or predict.</SUBTEXT>
    </SECTION>
    <SECTION>
        <SUBTITLE>Security</SUBTITLE>
        <SUBTEXT>The security of your Personal Information is important to us. We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the Personal Information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. For example, when you enter sensitive information on our Site, we encrypt that information using secure socket layer technology (“SSL”).
Although we make good faith efforts to store Personal Information in a secure operating environment that is not open to the public, you should understand that there is no such thing as complete security, and we do not guarantee that there will be no unintended disclosures of your Personal Information. If we become aware that your Personal Information has been disclosed in a manner not in accordance with this Privacy Policy, we will use reasonable efforts to notify you of the nature and extent of the disclosure (to the extent we know that information) as soon as reasonably possible and as permitted by law.</SUBTEXT>
    </SECTION>
    <SECTION>
        <SUBTITLE>Lost or Stolen Information</SUBTITLE>
        <SUBTEXT>You must promptly notify us if your contact data is lost, stolen, or used without permission. In such an event, we will remove that contact data from your account and update our records accordingly.</SUBTEXT>

        <SUBTITLE>Updates and Changes to Privacy Policy</SUBTITLE>
        <SUBTEXT>We reserve the right, at any time, to add to, change, update, or modify this Privacy Policy so please review it frequently.
