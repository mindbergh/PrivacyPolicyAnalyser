The Associated Press and its affiliates (collectively, “AP”, “we”) recognize the importance of protecting the privacy of personal information that may be provided to us by individual users or viewers of AP content online. Accordingly, we have adopted a privacy policy to govern how we treat such information. AP may change this privacy policy from time to time, in its sole discretion, and any such changes will become effective when the AP posts the revised privacy policy online. Your continued use of the AP.org web site (the “Site”) indicates Your consent to AP's privacy policy and the most current version then in effect.</SUBTEXT>

We may disclose the information we collect about You to our affiliates and to nonaffiliated third parties that perform services on our behalf, including, without limitation, marketing services; provided, however, that we will not disclose any credit card numbers which may be provided by You except for the purpose of payment for services.
