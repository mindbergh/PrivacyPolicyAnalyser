        <SUBTITLE>COLLECTION OF INFORMATION</SUBTITLE>
        <SUBTEXT>We collect information about you in various ways when you use our Services. For example, we collect information you provide to us when you register for an account, create a user profile, write a product review, participate in a contest or survey, use our Contact Us form or otherwise communicate with us. Such information may include your name, email address, biographic information, social media handle, social media profile and/or website URL, picture and any other information you choose to provide. We may also obtain information from other sources and combine that with information we collect on our Services. For example, if you create or log into your account through a third-party social media service, we will have access to certain information from that third party service, such as your name and account information, in accordance with the authorization procedures determined by such service.

When you access or use our Services, some information is automatically collected. For example, when you visit our Services through your computer, we automatically log your computer's operating system, Internet Protocol (IP) address, access times, browser type and language, and the website you visited before navigating to our Services. Additionally, when you visit our Services through your mobile device, we may also collect your unique device ID, device make and model, device IP address, mobile web browser type and version and mobile carrier. We also collect information about your usage and activity on our Services.

Cookies. We may automatically collect information using “cookies.” Cookies are small data files stored on your hard drive by a website. Among other things, cookies help us improve our Services and your experience. We use cookies to see which areas and features are popular and to count visits to our Services. Most web browsers are set to accept cookies by default. If you prefer, you can usually choose to set your browser to remove cookies and to reject cookies. If you choose to remove cookies or reject cookies, this could affect certain features or services of our Services.

Web Beacons. We may collect information using web beacons. Web beacons are electronic images that may be used on our Services or in our emails. We use web beacons to deliver cookies, count visits, understand usage and campaign effectiveness and to tell if an email has been opened and acted upon.

Third Party Analytics and Advertisements. We may also allow third parties to use cookies, web beacons and other devices or technologies to collect information about your use of the Services. The data collected typically includes information such as your IP address, the browser you use to visit our Services, pages viewed and conversion information. This information may be used by Digital Trends and third parties to, among other things, analyze data, determine the popularity of certain content, deliver advertising targeted to your interests and better understand the usage and visitation of our Services and other sites tracked by these third parties. This Policy does not apply to, and we are not responsible for, third party cookies, web beacons or other tracking technologies and we encourage you to check the privacy policies of these third parties to learn more about their privacy practices.
