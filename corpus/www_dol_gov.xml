        <SUBTITLE>Cookie Use Notice</SUBTITLE>
        <SUBTEXT>Cookies are small files that Web servers place on a user's hard drive. They can serve several functions, depending upon how they are designed:
they allow the website to identify you as a previous visitor each time you access a site;
they track what information you view at a site (important to commercial sites trying to determine your buying preferences);
in the more advanced cases they track your movements through many websites but not the whole Web;
businesses use them for customer convenience to allow them to produce a list of items to buy and pay for them all at one time and to garner information about what individuals are buying at their sites;
advertisers use them to determine the effectiveness of their marketing and offer insights into consumer preferences and tastes by collecting data from many websites; and
they can be used to help a website tailor screens for each customer's preference.
Some DOL pages have "session cookies," to facilitate use of that particular page. These disappear when the Web user terminates a Web session and closes the browser. DOL also permits the use of persistent cookies for the collection of Web metrics; however, DOL does not collect any personally identifiable information about visitors to our Web pages. Please see our DOL Persistent Cookie Notice that details the types of information collected and how to opt-out by changing the cookie settings in your browsers.
If you are concerned about the potential use of the information gathered from your computer by cookies, you can set your browser to prompt you before it accepts a cookie. Most Internet browsers have settings that let you identify and/or reject cookies.
For security purposes and to ensure that this service remains available to all users, our Web site also employs software programs to monitor network traffic to identify unauthorized attempts to upload or change information, or otherwise cause damage.
Unauthorized attempts to upload information or change information on this service are strictly prohibited and may be punishable under the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act of 1986 and The National Information Infrastructure Protection Act of 1996.</SUBTEXT>
