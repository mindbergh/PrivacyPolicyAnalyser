        <SUBTEXT>The website you have entered is owned and operated by, or on behalf of, WWE, Inc. or its affiliates (collectively, "WWE", "we" or "us").

Please note that this Privacy Policy contains capitalized words or phrases.  These words and phrases are defined terms.

WWE wants to help you make the most of your visit to our websites, and that includes helping to protect your personal privacy. Most of the features on our websites are offered without collecting any Personal Information from you, however some features require you to provide your Personal Information. For example, when you make a purchase or sign up for a paid service (such as in the WWE Shop), you are required to submit Personal Information in connection with our providing various products and services to you. You may also submit content of your own in areas of our websites and some of that User-Generated Content may contain Personal Information. For those areas of our websites and services that do require us to collect Personal Information or allow voluntary submission of Personal Information, this Privacy Policy will offer suggestions on how to make good decisions for yourself and your family.

This Privacy Policy discloses when and how we collect, use, share, and safeguard information from this website, and in connection with WWE Magazine subscriptions (whether through the websites, or otherwise). The Personal Information we collect depends on what you do when you visit our websites or use the various products or services we offer. This Privacy Policy also explains what to do if you do not want to provide Personal Information when you visit our websites, and how to correct, change or delete information you have already provided to us.

By using this website, you are agreeing to the terms of this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree with any terms or practices described in this Privacy Policy, please do not use our websites.

As used in this Privacy Policy, "Personal Information" means any information by which a particular natural person is reasonably identifiable.  Personal Information includes, for example a first name or initial and last name; a home or other physical address; a date of birth; an email address or other online contact information; or a telephone number.  When Personal Information is collected, you will know because you will be providing it to us; for example, you may fill out a form on the website or submit information via your account or profile, or in connection with requesting various products or services.  When you make a purchase or sign up for a paid service, we will also collect additional Personal Information such as your credit or debit card information or information concerning any other payment mechanism we accept ("Payment Information"). We will use Payment Information only as described in this Privacy Policy to process and complete the transactions you have requested.</SUBTEXT>

        <SUBTITLE>Children</SUBTITLE>
        <SUBTEXT>WWE is committed to providing special protection for the privacy of children who may visit our websites. We encourage parents to spend time online with their children, become familiar with the features of our websites and participate in the activities offered on our websites. For more information on getting involved in your children's online activities, please go to our WWE Parents site. Our protections for the privacy of children include the following:

We do not knowingly solicit, collect, use or retain any Personal Information, for any purpose whatsoever (including internal or external marketing or promotional purposes), from visitors to this website who are age 12 or younger. In addition, we will delete any records of such Personal Information that come to our attention.

We do not allow visitors who we know to be age 12 or younger to be listed in any directory of registered users, to participate in any of our chat services, to register for contests, sweepstakes, promotions, or newsletters, or to receive direct marketing from WWE or from our third-party affiliates or service or product providers.

We do collect Personal Information as part of registration processes so that users can obtain certain services, such as newsletters, and so that they can set up accounts or profiles.  No person may open such accounts or profiles if he or she is age 12 or younger. We do not knowingly allow such persons to register and our websites may employ features and procedures that are intended to help prevent under-age registrations. If we believe that a person who is age 12 or younger has registered with us or set up a profile, account, or has otherwise violated our age-related requirements for a profile,  we will terminate that registration and will undertake commercially reasonable efforts to delete any Personal Information we have obtained, including all content from any profile or account.  However, in such cases we may retain a copy of the deleted content for law enforcement and regulatory purposes and to protect WWE.

We recommend that minors who are age 13 or older consult with their parents before sending any information about themselves over the internet.</SUBTEXT>

        <SUBTITLE>Collection of Personal Information</SUBTITLE>
        <SUBTEXT>WWE collects Personal Information from visitors to our websites in a number of ways.  These include the following:

Subscriptions to our free newsletters, which include updates, special offers and promotions from WWE's various entities, subsidiaries, and affiliates.
Participation in contests and sweepstakes.
Registrations to receive free downloadable desktop applications (e.g., screensavers).
Registrations to participate in chat services (such as WWE.com chat and Pay Per View chats), message boards and the gaming area.
Registrations to send electronic greeting cards.
Registrations for individual accounts or profiles.
Purchases of merchandise, magazine subscriptions, Streaming Pay Per View events, and transactions where home delivery is required.
E-mail transmitted via various links on our websites.
The use of any of these services is entirely optional and voluntary; however, if you do not provide the Personal Information requested, we may elect to not make the related services available for your use. If you send us an e-mail in which you disclose Personal Information, we will use it to discuss the subject of your correspondence and, if appropriate, share it with other interested parties (such as manufacturers of merchandise you have purchased from a website).

If you send us an e-mail, you should know that e-mail is not necessarily secure against interception. So, if your communication needs to include sensitive information like your Payment Information or social security number, please contact us by postal mail or telephone (see contact us below) rather than e-mail.

WWE also collects Personal Information from individuals who subscribe to our magazines, whether this is done online, over the phone, by mail, etc.  We must collect certain Personal Information, such as names and addresses, to provide subscriptions.</SUBTEXT>

        <SUBTITLE>Cookies, Locally Shared Objects, and Other Technologies</SUBTITLE>
        <SUBTEXT>In order to track your use of our websites, "cookies" are employed. We - and our affiliates and advertising partners - use two types of cookies -- so-called "browser cookies" and "Flash cookies". Browser cookies (also called "HTTP cookies") are pieces of information that are sent by websites and stored in your computer's hard drive, which provide you a service by allowing us to recognize your computer to save you from having to re-enter the same data every time you visit our websites. They also allow us and our affiliates and advertising partners to learn how visitors use our websites. This user data is aggregated for tracking purposes primarily by tallying pages viewed throughout our websites and logging Internet Protocol ("IP") addresses, browser types, general geographic origin of access to our websites and similar usage data. Flash cookies (also called "Locally Shared Objects" or "LSOs") are also used to remember settings and preferences and to track usage. However,  Flash cookies are stored differently on your hard drive and are managed through a different interface than the one provided by your web browser. In general, Flash cookies are more persistent and can store more data that browser cookies.

Our websites may use other technologies such as pixel tags, web beacons, or other forms of local storage, including HTML5 local storage (collectively, "other technologies") in order to collect and track information about individuals to our websites.  Information collected from these types of technologies, and from cookies and Flash cookies, is collectively referred to as "website usage data."

Website usage data enables us to tailor our content to our visitors' interests and to help our affiliates and advertisers better understand the preferences of our audience. Providing website usage data to advertisers is essential to keeping as many of our services free to visitors as is reasonably possible. In general, website usage data information does not identify you, although we may combine this website usage data with Personal Information under this Policy.

Our third-party advertisers also may place, access or recognize a browser or Flash cookie on your hard drive or use other technologies to collect and track information about you in order to serve the most appropriate advertisements.  Advertisers may use browser or Flash cookies and other technologies in manners that are not fully described in this policy, and we make no promises about how they use them.

If you do not want to receive browser cookies, you may be able to set your browser to reject them. If you wish to disable or delete Flash cookies, you should consult the Help file for your Flash application, and/or visit http://helpx.adobe.com/flash-player/kb/disable-local-shared-objects-flash.html. However, if you turn cookies off (whether browser or Flash cookies), you may not have access to some WWE features and services. The other technologies that our websites may not be able to be disabled; if you are concerned about this, you should not use our websites.</SUBTEXT>

        <SUBTEXT>All Personal Information that WWE collects at our websites is transferred to, and accessed from, jurisdictions including the United States. By using this website and/or by submitting Personal Information to this website, you consent to having your information transferred to, and accessed from, any location worldwide, including the United States. You also consent to having your Personal Information processed and maintained in any location worldwide, including the United States.

    <SECTION>
        <SUBTITLE>How We Use Your Information</SUBTITLE>
        <SUBTEXT>We limit the manner in which your Personal and Payment Information is used. We will use the Personal and Payment Information you provide only in a manner that is consistent with this Privacy Policy. If we obtain Personal or Payment Information from a third party, such as a business partner, our use of that information is also governed by this Privacy Policy. We use Personal and Payment Information for purposes such as: providing you the products and services you want; administering or enforcing transactions you have requested; protecting your accounts from fraud, unauthorized access, or identity theft; verifying your identity in connection with transactions you have requested; and managing our business and protect our interests. We also use Personal Information (but not Payment Information) to better understand and serve the needs of the WWE community, and to provide news and information to community members on new content, products services, and features of WWE and/or our websites including, without limitation, via direct e-mail.  If you have registered with us and do not want to be contacted in the future by WWE or our advertising partners, please see Opt-Out below.

We may share Personal and Payment Information with our service providers to assist us with any of the purposes set forth above (which, for example, might include disclosures to attorneys, accountants, auditors, credit bureaus, data processors and technical systems consultants)  to the extent necessary or appropriate for them to perform their services to us.  In that connection, we may report information about your account(s) to credit bureaus and/or consumer reporting agencies.  By way of example, if you order a product or service from us or register for one of our contests, promotions, or interactive services, WWE may share Personal Information with other service providers, suppliers and other third parties (for example, sweepstakes sponsors or delivery services) that assist us in operating the websites or providing the products or services.

Please note that we will release your Personal or Payment Information if required to do so by law, search warrant, subpoena, court order or other legal process.  WWE may also disclose your Personal or Payment Information if we have a good faith belief that such disclosure is reasonably necessary to detect or prevent fraud or to protect the rights, property, health or personal safety of WWE, WWE employees, our third party licensors, customers or the public.  We may also disclose your Personal or Payment Information if you or your legal representative authorizes us to so or if it is necessary to perform credit checks or collect or report debts owed to us.

WWE reserves the right to transfer any Personal or Payment Information in the event we transfer all or a portion of our business or assets, such as bankruptcy, dissolution, merger or acquisition. If such a transfer should occur, the privacy policy of another company may supplant our policy.  However, we will use commercially reasonable efforts to try to require that the transferee uses Personal or Payment Information in a manner that is consistent with our policy.</SUBTEXT>
