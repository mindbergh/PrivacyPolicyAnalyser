        <SUBTITLE>PURPOSE</SUBTITLE>
        <SUBTEXT>The purpose of this Privacy Policy is to describe how Coursera, Inc. ("Coursera," "us," "we," or "our") collects, uses and shares information about you through our U.S. online interfaces (e.g., websites and mobile applications) owned and controlled by us, including www.coursera.org (collectively referred to herein as the "Site"). Please read this notice carefully to understand what we do. If you do not understand any aspects of our Privacy Policy, please feel free to contact us at feedback@coursera.org.

        <SUBTITLE>WHAT INFORMATION THIS PRIVACY POLICY COVERS</SUBTITLE>
        <SUBTEXT>This Privacy Policy covers information we collect from you through our Site. Some of our Site's functionality can be used without revealing any personal information, though for features or services related to the Online Courses, personal information is required. If you do not use these specific features or services on the Site, then the only information we collect will be "Non-Personal Information" (i.e., information that cannot be used to identify you). Non-Personal Information includes information such as the web pages that you have viewed. In order to access certain features and benefits on our Site, you may need to submit "Personally Identifiable Information" (i.e., information that can be used to identify you). Personally Identifiable Information can include information such as your name and email address, among other things. You are responsible for ensuring the accuracy of the Personally Identifiable Information you submit to Coursera. Inaccurate information may affect your ability to use the Site, the information you receive when using the Site, and our ability to contact you. For example, your email address should be kept current because that is one of the primary manners in which we communicate with you.</SUBTEXT>

        <SUBTITLE>WHAT YOU CONSENT TO BY USING OUR SITE</SUBTITLE>
        <SUBTEXT>Please understand that by submitting any Personally Identifiable Information to us, you consent and agree that we may collect, use and disclose such Personally Identifiable Information in accordance with this Privacy Policy and our Terms of Use, and as permitted or required by law. If you do not agree with these terms, then please do not provide any Personally Identifiable Information to us. If you refuse or withdraw your consent, or if you choose not to provide us with any required Personally Identifiable Information, we may not be able to provide you with the services that can be offered on our Site.</SUBTEXT>

        <SUBTITLE>WHAT INFORMATION WE COLLECT</SUBTITLE>
        <SUBTEXT>We gather two types of information about users through the Site:

Non-Personal Information. When users come to our Site, we may track, collect and aggregate Non-Personal Information indicating, among other things, which pages of our Site were visited, the order in which they were visited, when they were visited, and which hyperlinks were "clicked." We also collect information from the URLs from which you linked to our Site. Collecting such information may involve logging the IP address, operating system and browser software used by each user of the Site. Although such information is not Personally Identifiable Information, we may be able to determine from an IP address a user's Internet Service Provider and the geographic location of his or her point of connectivity.

We also use or may use cookies and/or web beacons to help us determine and identify repeat visitors, the type of content and sites to which a user of our Site links, the length of time each user spends at any particular area of our Site, and the specific functionalities that users choose to use. Essentially, cookies are a user's identification card for the Coursera servers. Web beacons are small graphic files linked to our servers that allow us to track your use of our Site and related functionalities. Cookies and web beacons allow Coursera to serve you better and more efficiently, and to personalize your experience at our Site. Cookies and web beacons are not used to retain Personally Identifiable Information. From time to time we may also use additional typical methods of collecting data.

You should be able to control how and whether cookies will be accepted by your web browser. Most browsers offer instructions on how to reset the browser to reject cookies in the "Help" section of the toolbar. If you reject our cookies, many functions and conveniences of this Site may not work properly.

In order to participate in the Forums, you may be required to register with us and/or provide us with Personally Identifiable Information such as your name and email address. Personally Identifiable Information shall not include any information posted or sent by or to you via any public Forum.

Please also reference our Terms of Use for our Rules for Online Conduct and additional information about proper use of our Forums.

Participation in Online Courses. Coursera offers users the opportunity to participate in an Online Course on or through the Site. If you desire to participate in a course, you will be asked to provide us with certain information necessary to conduct such a course. This information may include, among other things, your name and email address.

If you participate in an online course, we may collect from you certain student-generated content, such as assignments you submit to instructors, peer-graded assignments and peer grading student feedback. We also collect course data, such as student responses to in-video quizzes, standalone quizzes, exams and surveys.

Identity Verification. Coursera may offer you the ability to verify your identity (e.g., through the Signature Track or ACE-CREDIT courses) for selected classes. In order to enroll for these services, you are required to provide us with Personally Identifiable Information such as your name, address, date of birth, a headshot taken using a webcam, a photo identification document, and a sample of your typing patterns. Additionally, if you apply for financial aid in connection with these services, you are required to provide information regarding your income.

Surveys. We may receive Personally Identifiable Information when you provide information in response to a survey operated by us.

Partner sites providing Online Course related tools and services to Coursera users may collect nonfinancial individual level user data regarding the individual's use of that partner site while engaged with such Online Course related activities, and the partner sites may share that data with Coursera for the purpose of improving Coursera's services, the partner site's services, and the individual's education experience. This data includes information such as the amount of time spent on the partner site and pages viewed.

Third Party Credit Card Processing. Coursera provides you with the ability to pay for Online Courses and other services using a credit card through a third party payment processing service provider. Please note that our service provider - not Coursera - collects and processes your credit card information.</SUBTEXT>

We use various service providers, vendors and contractors (collectively, "Contractors") to assist us in providing our products and services to you. Our Contractors may have limited access to your Personally Identifiable Information in the course of providing their products or services to us, so that we in turn can provide our products and services to you. These Contractors may include vendors and suppliers that provide us with technology, services, and/or content related to the operation and maintenance of the Site or the Online Course. Access to your Personally Identifiable Information by these contractors is limited to the information reasonably necessary for the contractor to perform its limited function for us.

Government Authorities, Legal Rights and Actions. Coursera may share your Personally Identifiable Information with various government authorities in response to subpoenas, court orders, or other legal process; to establish or exercise our legal rights or to protect our property; to defend against legal claims; or as otherwise required by law.
