    <SECTION>
        <SUBTITLE>What Information About Me Is Collected and Stored</SUBTITLE>
        <SUBTEXT>We collect two basic types of information from you in conjunction with your use of the Sites, personal information and non-personal information. Personal information is information that you may supply to us, as described more fully below, i.e., when you subscribe, order, complete a survey, register for a Site or any part thereof, enter a contest, upload content, participate in a community, or provide your e-mail address. Personal information is any information that can individually identify you and includes your name, e-mail address, telephone number, postal address, credit card, billing and contact information. Non-personal information includes information that does not personally identify you but may include tracking and usage information about your location, demographics, use of the Sites and the Internet.

Personal Information

As a general matter, you can browse the Sites without submitting your personal information to us. However, there are a number of circumstances in which you may supply us with your personal information. The following lists the most common ways in which we may collect your personal information.

Registration for an account on the Sites
Sign up to receive e-mail newsletters from us
Request for customer service or other assistance
Participation in surveys, panels, or market research
Participation in special events and promotions
Purchases on the Sites
Entry in contests or sweepstakes
Participation on social media accounts involving Random House, our books and our brands
Participation in communities, chat rooms, and other interactive services
Submission of user generated content on any part of the Sites that permit it
Submission of a job application
Any other place on the Sites where you knowingly volunteer personal information

Collection of Personal Information From Social Media Sites

When you interact with any Random House property page or account on a social media platform, such as Facebook, Twitter, Google+, Tumblr, YouTube, or Pinterest, we may collect the personal information that you make available to us on that page or account including your account ID or "handle." However, we will comply with the privacy policies of the corresponding social media platform and we will only collect and store such personal information that we are permitted to collect by these social media platforms.

Non-Personal Information

In addition, when you interact with the Sites, our servers may keep an activity log that does not identify you individually ("Non-Personal Information"). Generally, we collect and store the following categories of Non-Personal Information:

Demographic data such as age, gender, and five digit zip code as part of collecting personal information
Device information about your computer, mobile device, or other device that you use to access the Sites. This information may include IP address, geolocation information, unique device identifiers, browser type, browser language, and other transactional information.
Usage information about your use of the Sites. This information includes a reading history of the pages you view. We use this information to provide you a more customized experience on the Sites.
Additional "traffic data" such as time of access, date of access, software crash reports, session identification number, access times, and referring website addresses.
Your search terms and search results.
Other information regarding our users' use of the Sites.

Collection of Your Source IP Address/Location Information

We collect and store your device's source IP address which may disclose the location of your device at the time you access the Sites. Advertisements and certain content may be directed to you as a result of this data.

In addition, in some cases the Sites can deliver content based on your current location if you choose to enable that feature. If you enable that feature, your current location will be stored locally on your device which will be used by the Sites to serve you certain content tied to your location. If you elect to have your location-based searches saved to your history, we will store such information on our servers.

Collection of Personal and Non-Personal Information From Other Sources

We also may collect and store information about you that we receive from other sources to, among other things, enable us to update and correct the information contained in our database and to better customize your experience on the Sites.

Use of Cookies, Flash Cookies and Web Beacons

Like many websites, we use "cookies", which are small text files that are stored on your computer or equipment when you visit certain online pages that record your preferences and actions. We use cookies to track use of our Sites and online services. We may also use cookies to monitor traffic, improve the Sites and make it easier and/or relevant for your use. You may occasionally get cookies from companies advertising on our behalf. We do not control these cookies, and these cookies are not subject to this cookie policy.

You have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but, if you prefer, you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies. For more information on cookies and how to disable them, you can consult the information provided by the Interactive Advertising Bureau at www.allaboutcookies.org.

We may also use web beacons or flash cookies. A web beacon or flash cookie (also known as "action tags", "tracer tags", or "single-pixel gifs") is an invisible graphic on a web page that is programmed to collect non-personal information about your use of a given website. We do not share or provide personal information we may collect through such web beacons, such as names, e-mail addresses and phone numbers with our advertisers without your express permission.

We work with third-party advertising companies who may utilize flash or enhanced cookies or web beacons to better provide advertisements about goods and services that may be of interest to you. These partners do not have access to or use your name, address, e-mail address, telephone number or other personal information from us. They may, however, anonymously track your Internet usage across other websites in their networks beyond these Sites. To learn more about the use of this information or to choose not to have this information used by our third-party advertising partners by opting out please visit the Network Advertising Initiative by clicking http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp.</SUBTEXT>
