        <SUBTEXT>Tracking Tools We Use

We or our vendors use several common online tracking tools.  These may include browser and flash cookies. We may also use web beacons and similar technologies.  We use these tools:
•  To track new visitors to our websites.
•  To recognize returning customers.
•  To store your password if you are registered on our website.
•  To provide you with advertising content in which we think you will be interested.  As part of this customization, we may observe your behaviors on this website or on other websites. We may also get information about your browsing history from our trusted business partners and vendors.
•  So we can better understand our audience, our customers, our website visitors, and their respective interests.

Controlling Our Tracking Tools

Your browser may give you the ability to control cookies.  How you do so depends on the type of cookie.  Certain browsers can be set to reject browser cookies.  To control flash cookies, click here. Why? Because flash cookies cannot be controlled through your browser settings.

If you configure your computer to block cookies, you will limit the functionality we can provide when you visit our websites.

Controlling Online Interest-Based Ads

We sometimes work with online advertising vendors to provide you with relevant and useful ads.  This may include ads served on our websites or mobile applications.  This may also include ads served on other companies' websites. These ads may be based on information collected by us or third parties.  For example, information a third party collects when you register for a website, like your zip code.  This might be used to target an ad for people in your area. These ads may also be based on your activities on our websites or on third party websites.
