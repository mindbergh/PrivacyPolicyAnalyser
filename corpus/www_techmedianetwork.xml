        <SUBTEXT>Welcome to TechMedia Network!

TechMedia Network has created this Privacy Policy in order to set forth the principles governing our information-gathering and dissemination practices, including but not limited to such activities as forums, chat rooms, personal profile pages, product reviews, article commentary, blogs, RSS feeds and newsletters, among other offerings. Tech MediaNetwork has a strong commitment to the privacy of our users. Please note that this Privacy Policy applies only to information collected through TechMedia Network and not to information collected offline or to information you may provide to any third-party sites to which TechMedia Network may link, except as expressly provided herein.</SUBTEXT>

        <SUBTITLE>Information We Collect</SUBTITLE>
        <SUBTEXT>There are two kinds of information that TechMedia Network can obtain about you: “Anonymous Information” and “Personally Identifiable Information.”

“Anonymous Information” consists of non-personally-identifiable data, such as your Internet Protocol (“IP”) address or domain, or information about your usage on TechMedia Network that is used for administrative purposes only. For example, an IP address is a unique string of numbers that is assigned to your computer by your Internet Service Provider. Web servers automatically identify your computer by its IP address. We may collect our users' IP addresses for such purposes as to help diagnose problems with our servers and to report aggregate information to our advertisers, corporate affiliates and consultants, and to third parties that perform particular services on our behalf.

We may also use the information linked to IP addresses to ban users who violate our Terms and Conditions of use.

“Personally Identifiable Information” is any information that personally identifies you, such as your name, street address, email address, or telephone number. We collect such information when, for example, you enter a contest, subscribe to our email newsletter, and participate in other interactive online activities such as forums.

When we collect Personally Identifiable Information from you, you will have the opportunity to “opt in” to receive email or other digital communications from us and/or our business partners.

If you have submitted your personal information to TechMedia Network, you may correct, amend or delete the Personally Identifiable Information maintained on file about you if it is incorrect.

If you are a registered Community member of TechMedia Network, you may manage your membership information as well as your subscriptions. Simply login to your community account and click on “Account Options.” Click on the tab marked “Account” to manage your password and email address; click on the tab marked “Subscriptions ” to manage your newsletter subscriptions and Click on the tab, “Profile” to edit your public profile.

In all cases, we will only use your information as permitted by law. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Privacy Policy, however, we may disclose Personally Identifiable Information to others if we are required to do so by law or we in good faith believe that such action is necessary to (a) comply with the law or with legal process; (b) protect and defend our rights and property; (c) protect against misuse or unauthorized use of the Site; or (d) protect the personal safety or property of our users or the public. Please note that we may not provide you with notice prior to disclosure in such cases.</SUBTEXT>

        <SUBTITLE>Use of "Cookies</SUBTITLE>
        <SUBTEXT>TechMedia Network uses “cookies” – data that is transferred from TechMedia Network to your hard drive for record-keeping purposes. We use cookies to deliver content specific to your interests and to save your password so you do not have to re-enter it each time you visit TechMedia Network. Some of the advertisements appearing on TechMedia Network are delivered by our third-party ad network, DoubleClick. In the course of serving advertisements, DoubleClick may place or recognize a unique “cookie” in your browser's cache, and may use Anonymous Information (including date/time of the banner ad displayed, the ad that was displayed and the IP address of the visitor) about your visits to this and other Web sites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you and to collect statistical information.

        <SUBTITLE>Disclosure of Information through Business Transfers</SUBTITLE>
        <SUBTEXT>As we continue to develop our business, we may buy, merge or partner with other companies or businesses, and in so doing, acquire customer information. In such transactions, user information may be among the transferred assets. Similarly, in the event that a portion or all of TechMedia Network's assets are sold or transferred to a third party, customer information (including your email address) would likely be one of the transferred business assets.</SUBTEXT>

Please note that your email, like most, if not all, unencrypted Internet communications, may potentially be accessed and viewed by other Internet users, without your knowledge and permission, while in transit to us. For that reason, to protect your privacy, please do not use email to communicate information to us that you consider confidential. While we strive to protect your personal information, TechMedia Network cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us. Once we receive your transmission, we will use reasonable efforts to ensure its security on our internal systems.
