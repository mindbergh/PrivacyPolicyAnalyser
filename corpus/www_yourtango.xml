Children
We care about the safety of children and take the protection of children's privacy very seriously. Tango won't knowingly allow anyone under age of 15 to provide us with any personal information, and we do not encourage participation or visitation by children. Children should always get permission from their parents before sending any personal information over the Internet, to us or to anyone else. We encourage you to become involved in your children's online experience.
