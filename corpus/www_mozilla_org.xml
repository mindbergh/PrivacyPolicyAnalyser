        <SUBTITLE>Our Principles</SUBTITLE>
        <SUBTEXT>The following six privacy principles stem from Mozilla's Manifesto and inform how we develop our websites, products and services. For details on our information handling practices across Mozilla, be sure to read our specific privacy notices and policies.:

No Surprises

Only use and share information about our users for their benefit and as spelled out in our notices.

Real Choices

Educate users whenever we collect any personal information and give them a choice whenever possible.

Sensible Settings

Establish default settings that balance safety and user experience appropriately.

Limited Data

Collect and retain the least amount of user information necessary. Try to share anonymous aggregate data whenever possible, and then only when it benefits the web, users or developers.

User Control

Do not disclose personal user experience without the user's consent. Innovate, develop and advocate for privacy enhancements that put users in control of their online experiences.

Trusted Third Parties

Make privacy a factor in selecting and interacting with partners.

        <SUBTITLE>Your Information</SUBTITLE>
        <SUBTEXT>We know how much you value your privacy. We build our web sites and design our products and features with your privacy in mind.

Our privacy policies and notices explain in detail what our different sites and products will and won't do with your information. They tell you what is collected, when it is collected, and for what reason it is collected. We want to be transparent and open about our privacy practices.

For us, "personal information" means:
information which identifies you, like your name or email address; or
a combination of several pieces of information which couldn't identify you on their own, but which we believe could become identifiable to you when combined.
Any information that falls outside of this is "non-personal information." If we store your personal information with information that is non-personal, we will consider the combination as personal information.

        <SUBTEXT>In Products
In the software we make we include privacy and security settings with a lot of functionality. There are also plenty of add-ons for some of our products, like Firefox, which you can use to get even more control over your online experience, interactions and information.

Email
If you signed up to receive a newsletter or other email communication from Mozilla, but no longer wish to do so, you can opt out from receiving them by following the “unsubscribe” instructions in the next email you receive.

Do Not Track
Do Not Track is a feature in Firefox (and some other sweet browsers) which lets you tell websites that you'd rather that they don't keep track of you. You can read more about Do Not Track and how to turn it on in Firefox.

        <SUBTITLE>When we share your Information</SUBTITLE>
        <SUBTEXT>We may release information in the following situations:

When we tell you we will and you consent to the sharing.
For processing or providing products and services to you, but only if those entities receiving your information are contractually obligated to handle the data in ways that are approved by Mozilla.
When we engage vendors, we negotiate to include contract terms that require vendors: (a) to limit use of the user information that we provide them only for the provision of their services to us and (b) not to correlate that user information with other information they might have.
When we are fulfilling our mission of being open. We sometimes release information to make our products better and foster an open web, but we will try to remove your personal information and disclose it in a way that minimizes the risk of you being re-identified.
When the law requires it. We follow the law whenever we receive requests about you from a government or related to a lawsuit, and we'll notify you when we're asked to hand over your personal information unless we're legally prohibited from doing so. When we receive requests like this, we'll only release your information if we have a good faith belief that the law requires us to do so. Nothing in this policy is intended to limit any legal defenses or objections that you may have to a third party's request to disclose your information.
When we believe it is necessary to prevent harm to you or someone else, provided that we will do so only if we have a good faith belief that it is reasonably necessary to protect the rights, property or safety of you, our other users, Mozilla or the public.
If our organizational structure or status changes (if we undergo a restructuring, are acquired, or go bankrupt,) we may pass your information to a successor or affiliate.
