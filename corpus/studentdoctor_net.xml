        <SUBTEXT>We use the personal information you supply us, including your registration data, to enhance our services; fulfill your requests for products, programs, or services; and personalize your experience. We also use other information obtained from user site traffic patterns to better provide you with a personalized experience.

The Student Doctor Network uses the information described above to do, among other things, the following:

Personalize and enhance the site and service such as providing you with information we believe will be of interest to you.
We may also use the information we collect to develop summary reports for our advertisers. An example of a summary report might be “100,000 people clicked on this advertisement.” We provide this information to assist our advertisers in determining how to promote their products. We do not tell our advertisers who it was that saw or clicked on their advertisements.
Information that you provide while using products such as SDN Forums and SDN Chat is available for all to see. Discretion should be used in entering Personally Identifiable Information within such forums, as it may be collected by third parties. The Coastal Research Group does not actively associate the message content entered by our users in SDN Forums, or SDN Chat with those users' registration information. Our server computers will retain this information. It is available for distribution to law-enforcement agencies acting under subpoena power. See “Legal Disclaimer” below.

We do link the information we store in cookies to personally identifiable information you submit while on our site. We do this to allow you to remain logged-in while using the SDN Forums, Wiki, Classifieds and My SDN Space.

We use both session ID cookies and persistent cookies. We use session cookies to make it easier for you to navigate our site. A session ID cookie expires when you close your browser. A persistent cookie remains on your hard drive for an extended period of time. You can remove persistent cookies by following directions provided in your Internet browser's “help” file.

Cookies are used to enhance your experience at the SDN Forums. We set a persistent cookie to store your passwords, so you don't have to enter it more than once. Persistent cookies also enable us to track and target the interests of our users to enhance the experience on our site.

If you reject cookies, you may still use our site, but your ability to use some areas of our site, such as the SDN Forums, will be limited.

Some advertisers use cookies on our site. We have no access to or control over these cookies. This privacy statement covers the use of cookies by this site only and does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers. See the “Third Party Advertisers” section.</SUBTEXT>

        <SUBTITLE>Clear Gifs (Web Beacons/Web Bugs</SUBTITLE>
        <SUBTEXT>We employ, and/or our third party advertising partner, Google, may employ a software technology called clear gifs (a.k.a. Web Beacons/Web Bugs), that help us better manage content on our site by informing us what content is effective. Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of Web users. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user's computer hard drive, clear gifs are embedded invisibly on Web pages and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence. We do not tie the information gathered by clear gifs to our customers' personally identifiable information.

To learn more about Google's use of clear gifs, please go to www.google.com.</SUBTEXT>
