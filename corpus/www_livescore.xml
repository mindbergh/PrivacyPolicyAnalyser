        <SUBTITLE>What are cookies and why do we use them</SUBTITLE>
        <SUBTEXT>LiveScore, as well as most sites on the Internet, uses "cookies" to enhance your experience on the web. LiveScore cannot use these cookies to personally identify you in any way.

A cookie is a small piece of information that is sent to your browser from a World Wide Web Server. This block of data can be anything, a unique user ID generated by the server, the current date and time, the IP Address of where the browser is logged onto the net or any other chunk of data that you want.

After a browser receives a cookie it will then send that cookie to the server that set it whenever it is appropriate and required/requested. The browser will only send the cookie to the server that originally set it. This means that the server can't tell if your browser has cookies that other sites have sent.</SUBTEXT>

        <SUBTEXT>An HTTP Cookie cannot be used to get data from your hard drive, get your email address or steal sensitive information about your person.

The LiveScore Web Server(s) will send a Cookie to a Client system when our adserver serves an ad in order to record unique ID associated with this ad so that should you decide to click on the ad, your browserknows which advertiser's web page to redirect you to. We may or may not also use cookies to enhance your experience on our website (personalization,...).

We believe cookies to be harmless, and will eventually be to everyone's benefit (end users, as well as site builders).</SUBTEXT>
