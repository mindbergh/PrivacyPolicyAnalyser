        <SUBTEXT>NPR's Privacy Policy is summarized here. Please scroll down to see the full Privacy Policy.

Location-Based Services

NPR collects geolocation data through the NPR Services for purposes of offering visitors relevant content, including content from nearby Member stations. Geolocation data consists of general location information based on latitude and longitude, rounded to a few miles radius, or based on IP addresses.

Gathering of Information

NPR collects contact information, such as name, address, email address, and phone number, that users voluntarily submit by, for example, registering for newsletters or an NPR account, creating a public profile for your account, making a purchase in the NPR Shop, sharing a story, or submitting comments or materials to NPR.
NPR collects credit card numbers provided by NPR Shop customers.
NPR's web server creates access logs for visitors to the NPR Services, recording such information as IP address, date and time of visit, path taken, browser, list of files downloaded or viewed, and time spent listening to audio.
NPR collects information from a visitor's mobile device or app, including device identifier, operating system, phone model, app version and automobile make.
NPR may collect information related to content preferences.
NPR may collect a visitor's personal information (such as age or gender) (a) that the visitor has chosen to associate with the visitor's social media account(s), with the visitor's specific additional consent, or (b) in aggregated, non-identifying form through third party vendors.
NPR uses cookies and web beacons to track certain user activity. NPR's third party vendors that provide analytics services, provide NPR's discussion platform, and serve sponsorship messages also may use their own cookies and web beacons.
Use of Information

NPR uses the personal information it gathers (a) to provide requested products and services, (b) to identify users when NPR publishes material they submitted, and (c) for internal NPR and NPR Member station purposes.
NPR uses access logs, content preferences, cookies, web beacons, and third party analytics data to analyze use of the NPR Services, offer interactive features, and personalize the NPR Services, such as by recalling user information so that the user does not have to re-enter it, offering local station content or other content that may be of interest to the visitor, and displaying more relevant sponsorship messages.
Sharing Information with Third Parties

NPR generally does not share personal information it gathers with third parties, except with NPR member stations, NPR service vendors (to the extent necessary for the vendor to provide the services), and other third parties when the user consents.
Any information a user posts or shares through the NPR Services will become available to the public.
NPR will release user information when required to do so by law or when it believes it is necessary to protect NPR, NPR employees, users of the NPR Services, or the public.

        <SUBTITLE>Full Version of Privacy Policy</SUBTITLE>
        <SUBTEXT>At NPR (which refers to NPR and its subsidiary organizations), we recognize the importance of privacy to visitors of NPR.org, NPR's mobile sites and applications, any other NPR sites, applications and services, and any features of these sites, applications and services (the "NPR Services"). This Privacy Policy explains what type of information is collected from you when you visit the NPR Services and how that information may be used. Please note that this Privacy Policy is separate and distinct from the privacy policies governing the web sites, applications and services of NPR's member stations, and the web sites, applications and services that may link to or from the NPR Services.</SUBTEXT>

        <SUBTITLE>Gathering of Information</SUBTITLE>
        <SUBTEXT>NPR collects personally-identifying information (such as your name, e-mail address, address, telephone number, and credit card information) from the NPR Services for a variety of purposes.

NPR asks visitors to provide certain personal information when they register for certain features or services of the NPR Services (for example, an NPR account, Application Programming Interface (API) Content access, and NPR e-mail newsletters), when they create a public profile for their NPR account, when they e-mail, send via SMS (Short Message Service) or text message, or otherwise share a story from the NPR Services, when they make a purchase from the NPR Shop, when they post, upload, transmit and/or otherwise submit ("Submit") a comment, message, story idea, essay, photo, image, or other text, content or material ("User Materials"), and when they register for an NPR tour or event or any online contests. NPR also may ask visitors to provide personal information in other limited circumstances specified at the time the information is gathered. Any information that you Submit on or through NPR's social networking features, forums and discussions, as part of story or blog comments, or otherwise Submit to the NPR Services, may become public, including the full name and nickname that you provide when registering an NPR account or creating a public profile.

Within NPR's mobile sites and applications and any features of these sites and applications ("NPR Mobile Services"), NPR collects a device's operating system, phone model, app version, automobile make, and content preferences. NPR also collects geolocation data through the NPR Services. Geolocation data consists of general location information based on latitude and longitude, rounded to a few miles radius, or based on IP addresses.

NPR also may collect other personal information (such as age, gender or other demographic information) (a) that the visitor has chosen to associate with his or her own social media account(s), if the visitor provides specific additional consent through the authentication process for the visitor's social media account provider(s), or (b) in aggregated non-identifying form through third-party vendors that use cookies to provide analytics services.

Like all other Web servers, NPR's Web server automatically creates log files for each visitor who accesses the NPR Services. These "access logs" allow us to make our site more useful to our visitors. The access logs do NOT record a visitor's name, address, e-mail address, credit card numbers, or any other personally-identifying information. Rather, they contain some or all of the following information:

The Internet Protocol Address (IP Address) of the machine which accessed the NPR
Services.
General location information (based on IP Address)
Device identifier (for users of NPR Mobile Services)
The date of the visit.
The time of the visit.
The path taken through the NPR Services, including any "favorites" selected by user.
Other content preferences
The browser being used.
A list of files downloaded or viewed.
The amount of time spent listening to/viewing media files.
Any errors encountered.</SUBTEXT>

        <SUBTITLE>Cookies and Other Technologies</SUBTITLE>
        <SUBTEXT>NPR also uses 'cookies' to collect information. A cookie is a string of characters that can be written to a file on the user's hard drive when the user visits a web site, application or service. Only the web site, application or service that set the cookie can read it, and it can only be used as a record keeping device to store user IDs and information that the site already has. It cannot be used to read other information from the user's hard drive.

NPR uses cookies to track users' activity through the NPR Services, and uses information gathered through third party vendor cookies, to improve the site/application/service architecture, to offer the user interactive features that would not be possible without them, to offer local station content or other content that may be of interest to the visitor, to recall specific information to save the user time during subsequent visits to the NPR Services, and to direct more relevant sponsorship or underwriting messages to the user while the user is on the NPR Services. For example, cookies allow NPR to remember your registration information while you are logged in. Local station customization, the NPR Shop, and other interactive features also use cookies.

Third party vendors that measure and analyze the use of the NPR Services for NPR, provide NPR's discussion platform and serve sponsorship messages onto the NPR Services, also use their own cookies. For example, NPR's third party analytics vendors use cookies across multiple websites to collect user data (such as data related to age, gender and user interests.) In addition, NPR works with third party vendors which may serve sponsorship or other messages to you on other web sites after you visit the NPR Services. These third party vendors use their own cookies to recognize you as an NPR Services visitor and to serve you sponsorship or other messages on other web sites that they believe you will find most relevant.

NPR and its third party vendors also may use web beacons, alone or in conjunction with cookies. A web beacon is an electronic image, also known as a single-pixel (1x1) or clear .gif., which can be used to recognize certain information on your computer, such as cookies, the time and date a page is viewed, or a description of where API Content is placed. We may use web beacons on this site from time to time for these and other purposes.</SUBTEXT>

    <SECTION>
        <SUBTITLE>Opting Out of Cookies and Web Beacons</SUBTITLE>
        <SUBTEXT>If you wish to prevent certain or all cookies or web beacons from being set to your hard drive or device, or to clear existing cookies or web beacons from your browser's or device's cache, you may be able to disable them in your browser's preferences, although your browser might then be unable to accommodate certain functionalities on the NPR Services. Visitors desiring to prevent data from being collected by Google Analytics may use the opt-out browser add-on developed by Google for this purpose.

In addition, if you wish to opt out of receiving personalized or "interest-based" sponsorship or other messages from our third party vendors and other participating companies, please visit http://networkadvertising.org/choices. Please note that if you opt out, you will still receive other types of messages that are not personalized or interest-based. Opting out is cookie-based and will only affect the specific computer and browser on which the opt out is applied. If you subsequently delete your browser cookies, you will need to opt out again.

    <SECTION>
        <SUBTITLE>Use of Information</SUBTITLE>
        <SUBTEXT>The use of personally-identifying information is limited to the following: managing and administering the NPR Services; responding to user messages; listing name and location (city, state and/or country) information provided by users when broadcasting or publishing User Materials; fulfillment of NPR Shop orders; offering access to NPR tours and events; contest management; editorial purposes such as contacting users for an online survey; sending NPR e-mail newsletters and other communications, including marketing and promotional communications, from NPR or NPR member stations to users who have 'opted in' to the receipt of such communications; other internal NPR or NPR member station purposes; and other purposes specified at the time the information is gathered. Any geolocation data collected through NPR Services is used to offer relevant content, including content from nearby Member stations to the visitor. NPR may contact users regarding their submissions in certain circumstances.

Any information that you disclose when participating in the NPR social networking features, forums or discussions (including creating a profile or submitting a comment to a story or blog or in a discussion thread), such as your full name and any nickname, is likely to become public. This information may be posted on the NPR Services and on the platform of NPR's third party discussion services vendor. In addition, NPR, its member stations and their licensees, may use, copy, sublicense, modify, transmit, publicly perform, display, create derivative works of, host, index, cache, tag, encode, and/or adapt any User Materials, and any information contained therein, in any and all media formats or channels, whether now known or hereafter devised, including, but not limited to, the NPR Services, NPR member station web sites and services, other third party web sites and services, over the air (on radio or television), and on mobile platforms. Further, other users of the NPR Services may embed a widget or feed that allows your User Materials to appear on their personal, noncommercial web site, blog or other application, subject to conditions set forth in the Terms of Use. You also may opt in to sharing your NPR Services profile and comments with other websites and social media platforms, but only by taking action on the website for NPR's third party discussion services vendor. Any such action is governed by the terms and privacy policy of NPR's third party discussion services vendor, and not of NPR.

In addition, if you send User Materials to NPR through the NPR Services, we may print the User Materials, or an excerpt from the User Materials, on the NPR Services, read them on air, or otherwise publish them in any other medium, together with your name and location (city, state and/or country) if you provide that information to us.

Excluding information provided by the user when participating in the NPR social networking features, forums or discussions, or sending User Materials to NPR, which may become public as discussed above, personally-identifying information collected by NPR is not provided to outside parties except NPR member stations, NPR service vendors (such as NPR Shop fulfillment service, NPR's email list manager, and the provider of the tool that allows users to sign in using information from their account with a third party service), and other third parties when the user specifically consents to such distribution (such as the disclosure of your name to a friend when you email, send via SMS or text message, or otherwise share a story to that friend). In these circumstances, the information is provided for the sole purpose of — and only to the extent necessary for — delivering the requested goods to the user, delivering communications from NPR or NPR member stations to users who have 'opted in' to the receipt of these communications, providing services for and on behalf of NPR, or serving other internal NPR or NPR member station purposes. Visitors to the NPR Mobile Services should be aware that the wireless carrier for your mobile device or the automobile manufacturer also may collect personally-identifying information and geolocation data. Visitors should check the privacy policies of their wireless carriers and automobile manufacturers for additional information.

NPR also may disclose personal information if required to do so by law or if it believes that such action is necessary to (a) comply with the law or with legal process, (b) protect against misuse or unauthorized use of the NPR Services, or (c) protect the personal safety or property of users of the NPR Services, the public or NPR and its employees.

If you do not want your personally-identifying information to be collected or used for any of these purposes, please do not provide it (although if you do not provide it, you may not be able to use or participate in certain features of the NPR Services). You can also 'opt out' according to the process described below.

NPR, with the assistance from time to time of its third party service vendors, uses non-identifying aggregate information, including non-identifying aggregate data regarding age, gender and/or user interests, to analyze use of and better design the NPR Services and to share with third parties in aggregate form only as appropriate. For example, we may tell a third party that a certain number or category of users accessed a particular audio stream on the NPR Services. We also may share non-identifying aggregate information with third party services that combine NPR's information with aggregate information from other sources to provide ratings and ranking data or other services of value to NPR. However, we will not disclose any information that could be used to identify those users.</SUBTEXT>

    <SECTION>
        <SUBTITLE>Security</SUBTITLE>
        <SUBTEXT>NPR has in place what we believe to be appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect online. Credit card information provided to the NPR Shop is protected against unauthorized use by 128-bit encryption and Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) security features, which scramble your personal information so that only your browser and the NPR Shop's server can decipher it. However, no Internet, e-mail or mobile transmission is ever fully secure or error free. Because most e-mail and mobile transmissions are not encrypted, you should take special care in deciding what information you send to us via e-mail, SMS or text message, or other mobile transmission.</SUBTEXT>

    <SECTION>
        <SUBTITLE>Children</SUBTITLE>
        <SUBTEXT>Under 13: If you are under 13 years of age, please do not send any information about yourself, including your name, address or e-mail address. If we discover that we have collected any personally-identifying information from a child under the age of 13, we will remove that information from our database as soon as possible.

13-18: You must be at least 18 years old in order to Submit any User Materials on or through the NPR Services, create a public profile, participate in any online contests, or place an order on the NPR Shop. Visitors between the ages of 13 and 18 must obtain permission from their parents or guardians before registering for e-mail newsletters or other features of the NPR Services or otherwise sending any personally-identifying information.</SUBTEXT>

    <SECTION>
        <SUBTITLE>Corrections to Personal Data; Opting Out</SUBTITLE>
        <SUBTEXT>Please Contact Us to a) correct or update any personal information in the NPR database that you state is erroneous, b) opt-out of future communications from NPR, or c) request NPR to make reasonable efforts to remove your personal information from NPR's database, thereby canceling your NPR account, NPR newsletter registration and other NPR registrations. This will not necessarily remove previous public comments and other User Materials Submitted for public display on the NPR Services. The user understands that it may be impossible to delete personal information entirely because of backups and records of deletions.</SUBTEXT>

        <SUBTITLE>Links to other Sites and Services</SUBTITLE>
        <SUBTEXT>It is important to note that the NPR Services contain links to other sites, applications and services maintained by third parties that may not follow the same privacy policies as the NPR Services. For instance, clicking or tapping on a sponsorship notice or some third party logos on the NPR Services will take you to an entirely different site, application or service. These sites, applications and services may use cookies, collect data, and use the data in ways that the NPR Services would not. NPR is not responsible for the privacy practices or any information or materials on these other sites. Please visit these sites if you wish to review their privacy policies.

In some cases, the NPR Services may include certain embedded tools provided and controlled by third parties and governed by the terms and policies of the third parties. You should only use these third party tools if you agree to their respective terms and policies.

The NPR Services include a tool that allows you to sign in or share content using information from your account with a third party service, such as Facebook, Twitter, Google, Yahoo, OpenID, or LinkedIn. Please be aware that those third party services are unrelated to NPR, and that your use of the third party services is subject to the terms and policies of those services.</SUBTEXT>
