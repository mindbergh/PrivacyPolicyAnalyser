        <SUBTEXT>What is RhymeZone?

RhymeZone is a website that aims to be the best and fastest way to find English words. It has been in continuous operation since 1996.
What can I do with RhymeZone?

You can use it to help write poetry, song lyrics, greeting cards, term papers, and more. You can use it to explore relationships between words. You can use it to find the correct spelling of a word you're not quite sure of. You can use it as a springboard for finding pictures, documents, and other multimedia items related to a particular concept that you're writing about. Finally, you can use it to see how your word is used in the context of famous quotes, poems, and plays.

To use RhymeZone, type a word into the box above, select a function in the dropdown list next to the box, and then hit "Go get it!" to view the results. Here are the different functions that you can select from that dropdown list:
Find rhymes: This function will return words that exactly rhyme with the word you typed in.
Find near rhymes: This function will return words that almost rhyme with the word you typed in.
Find synonyms: This function will return words that are the same or similar in meaning to the word you typed in.
Find anonyms: This function will return words that can mean the opposite of what you typed in.
Find definition: This function will search for definitions of the word you typed in. It will also allow you to submit your query to other online dictionaries on the Web.
Find homophones: This function will return words that have exactly the same pronunciation as what you typed in but are spelled differently.
Find similar sounding words: This function will return words that have a pronunciation that's similar, but not necessarily the same, as what you typed in.

Find related words: This option will return words that are related in some important way to what you typed in.
