Welcome to the Cabela's Online Store. In order to make you feel comfortable and secure in our online store, Cabela's has taken numerous precautions to guard your security while making purchases online. Our goal is to make you feel as comfortable shopping here as you would from our catalog or retail showrooms.

        <SUBTITLE>What personally identifiable information is being collected?</SUBTITLE>
        <SUBTEXT>When you visit or make use of Cabela's Tech Resources, you may be asked to provide us with personally identifiable information in order for us to provide you with the products or services that you have requested. For example, when you order a product, we may ask you to become a registered user of our web site, during which you will be asked for your name, shipping and billing addresses, your e-mail address, and your credit card number or other payment-related information. If you request one of our newsletters or send an inquiry to one of our customer service representatives, we will also store a record of your request along with your e-mail address. In addition, our Web servers track various technical details about your visit, such as you computer's IP address and which pages you visited, however that information does not typically contain any personally identifiable information about you. We use this information to monitor and improve our Tech Resources as well as personalize your experience with Cabela's through direct on-line advertising.

We post customer testimonials on our web site which may contain personally identifiable information such as the customer's name. We do obtain the customer's consent prior to posting the testimonial to post their name along with their testimonial.

When you order a gift certificate you are given the opportunity to include the name and a message for the party receiving the gift certificate. This information is only captured as part of this specific order process and is not stored.

Our web site includes links to other web sites whose privacy practices may differ from those of Cabela's Inc. If you submit personally identifiable information to any of those web sites, your information is governed by their privacy policy. We encourage you to carefully read the privacy policy of any web site you visit.</SUBTEXT>

        <SUBTITLE>How is the personally identifiable information being used?</SUBTITLE>

It is also used to improve the content of our web site, to notify you of problems with your requests, or to update you about changes to our web site.

        <SUBTITLE>With whom do we share your personally identifiable information?</SUBTITLE>
        <SUBTEXT>In order to operate this web site and in order to provide you with the products and services you have requested, we occasionally need to share information with third parties. We may transmit your personally identifiable information to service providers who assist us with processing orders, shipping products to you, processing your payment information, sending you catalogs, conducting surveys and product reviews, on- and offline sweepstakes, contests or promotions, processing job applications, sending you e-mails and newsletters, and helping us decide whether to extend credit to you (for example, the Cabela's CLUB® Visa® card). We have agreements with these service providers that they will protect your privacy in accordance with our standard Privacy Policy. Some of those organizations may have their own Privacy Policies which may give you additional protections, so you are encouraged to read those policies when presented to you. These companies are authorized to use your personally identifiable information only as necessary to provide these services to us.

We use software tools and service providers to help us gather and analyze information about our customers (anonymous traffic, and from time to time, individual user activity) on our web site. By reporting and tracking ads served on our site, these service providers help us conduct our business, optimize our ad campaigns through the use of data analytics, and deliver the most relevant products and services. They are not permitted to use your personally identifiable information for any secondary purposes.

We use one or more service providers to send direct marketing messages on our behalf via email. Their only role is to help us conduct our business and deliver marketing messages that we believe are the most relevant to you. They are not permitted to use your personally identifiable information for any secondary purposes.

We also use a service provider for tracking and processing job applications. No personally identifiable information is collected unless specifically entered by the user. This information is only used in connection with applying for a position at Cabela's Inc. You may review this vendor's privacy policy here or to have your information deleted from the career database, please email to this address.

We contract with service providers to serve ads on our behalf across the Internet and sometimes on this web site. They will collect anonymous information about your visits to our web site, and your interaction with our products and services. They may also use information about your visits to this and other web sites to target advertisements for goods and services. These targeted advertisements may appear on our web site or on other sites that you visit. The anonymous information is collected through the use of a pixel tag, which is industry standard technology used by most major web sites. No personally identifiable information is collected in this process. If you do not want these service providers to collect this information you may opt out. Opting out will not in any way affect your use of our web site.

When you download an application from us for use on your smartphone, we use a service provider to provide marketing messages to your device based on your location through their software platform. You must opt-in to both location services and push notifications in order for the application to deliver marketing messages to your device.</SUBTEXT>

        <SUBTITLE>What information will be disclosed if required by law?</SUBTITLE>
        <SUBTEXT>If required by law, we may provide any and all information we have about you to law enforcement or other government agencies, pursuant to a subpoena, warrant, or other order by a court of competent jurisdiction. In all cases, we will require written documentation of the request, proof of the identity of the law enforcement official making the request, and we will take steps to authenticate the validity of the request. Any law enforcement or government agency request submitted with less than a court-issued order will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis according to the need and urgency, as well as the particular law enforcement agency making the request. If Cabela's Inc. is involved in a merger, acquisition, or sale of all or a portion of its assets, you will be notified via email and/or a prominent notice on our web site of any change in ownership or uses of your personally identifiable information, as well as any choices you may have regarding your personally identifiable information.</SUBTEXT>

        <SUBTITLE>What personally identifiable information is collected in Cabela's Talk Forums, Trophy Rooms, and other Tech Resources sites?</SUBTITLE>
        <SUBTEXT>On certain portions of our web site as well as through our Tech Resources, we provide message board, chat rooms, social media platforms, entry forms for contests, sweepstakes and promotions, mobile applications and other functions that are geared towards user mobility features such as status updates, check-in, and bragging rights, some with geo-tagging features. Those features may require you to provide additional registration information, such as creating a username and password, providing an e-mail address, mobile phone number or other information, and in some instances may ask for you to consent to have your registration, image or contact information shared with third parties that have partnered with Cabela's as part of the contest, sweepstake or promotion. It is important to understand that when you participate in some of these enhanced Tech Resources, much of the information you choose to provide is considered "public knowledge" and it is your responsibility to protect your own privacy. If you register to use any of these features, contests, promotions or sweepstakes, we will keep your information private, in accordance with this privacy policy, and any contest, promotion or sweepstakes rules. You have the choice of making certain information about yourself available to other users of the system. It is your responsibility to manage your account settings in order to maintain the level of privacy that you desire. If you inadvertently post private or other inappropriate information, we will do our best to assist you in removing it, but we will not be responsible for any problems arising from your errors. These enhanced Tech Resources are provided without any warranty and you use them at your own risk.

In the event you upload to us content such as commentary or photographs to any of these Tech Resources, you warrant that you have the right to publish such content and give Cabela's Inc. and it subsidiaries and affiliates the unlimited right to use such content. While you are allowing us to use the content, you always own all of your content, but we ask that you abide by the terms of services of the application service providers with respect to intellectual property rights, and to hold Cabela's harmless from any third party claims of intellectual property rights violations resulting from you uploading content to our various Tech Resources. Because of the nature of internet services and mobile/social media platforms, you may not be able to select an audience for your postings (like when you write on a Page wall or comment on an article or posting made by another). This is because some types of stories are always public stories. As a general rule, you should assume that the information will be publicly available to all who visit Cabela's. Cabela's reserves the right to approve or reject content uploaded by you.</SUBTEXT>

        <SUBTITLE>What are cookies and how do we use them?</SUBTITLE>
        <SUBTEXT>A cookie is a block of text placed in a file on the user's hard drive by a web site you've visited. These types of cookies cannot identify an individual user specifically, such as by name or address, unless the cookie data is attached to personally identifiable information such as online registration. Cabela's uses cookies to observe visitor's navigation throughout our web site. This helps us identify ways to improve the shopping experience, personalize our web site, and collect anonymous information to provide direct online advertising.

Cabela's also uses both session cookies and persistent cookies, which is a piece of identification between your browser and our server, which helps to do things like keep track of the items in a user's shopping cart, and other information. The shopping cart cookie is saved for a designated period of time in case the users' session expires or they return to complete a purchase within that time frame. For the convenience of our users, we also place a persistent cookie on the users' computer when they log in to our talk forums. This gives the advantage of not having to log back in when moving between the talk forums and the rest of the web site. We do not link cookies placed through our web site to Personally Identifiable Information.

        <SUBTITLE>Security</SUBTITLE>
        <SUBTEXT>What kind of security procedures are in place to protect the loss, misuse or alteration of information under our control?
Cabela's values your business and is committed to doing everything possible to make our online ordering process secure. As always, our 100% satisfaction guarantee applies to any and all purchases from Cabela's.

Secure Ordering Process

Any credit card information you enter on our site is strongly encrypted by industry-standard protocol, SSL (Secure Sockets Layer). The Cabela's Web site uses SSL to communicate with secure browsers like Netscape and Internet Explorer. These browsers encrypt your credit card and personally identifiable information in a way that makes it extremely difficult for anyone to intercept and misuse while being transmitted between your computer and our server. Don't worry if your browser is secure or not - if it is insecure, you will not be able to purchase on our online store.

Once you have completed your order online, our security procedures do not end. We take appropriate precautions to protect the security and privacy of the information stored on our computer networks. Many of the systems which store your personally identifiable information are not connected to the Internet, reducing the likelihood of security breaches. Our systems are also housed in secure facilities, and access to your data by our employees is limited to a "need to know" basis, controlled by password protected systems, and monitored for abuse. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure. Therefore, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.

If you are still unsure of giving your credit card over the Internet, please feel free to phone, fax, or mail your order to us. For telephone ordering or assistance, please call 1-800-237-4444. Our fax number for orders is 1-800-496-6329 (for US/Canada 1-308-254-2200). Or, send your order to:

Cabela's
Attn: Order Processing
One Cabela Drive
