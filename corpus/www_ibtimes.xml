        <SUBTITLE>INTRODUCTION</SUBTITLE>
        <SUBTEXT>This Privacy Policy describes how International Business Times, Inc. ("IBTimes," "us" or "we"), will collect and use your personally identifiable information ("PII") (that is -- your full name, email address, mailing address, telephone number, or credit card number) as well as data that can, under certain circumstances, indirectly lead to PII ("Related Data").

This Policy applies to PII and Related Data received by us from consumers when they visit, register or subscribe to the online editions of International Business Times (www.ibtimes.com) and related services or sites that link to this Privacy Policy.

From time to time International Business Times may revise this Privacy Policy. If we make revisions that change the way we collect or use your PII or Related Data, those changes will be posted in this Privacy Policy and the effective date will be noted at the beginning of the Policy. Therefore, you should review it periodically so that you are up to date on our most current policies and practices. If we make material changes to our practices regarding use of your PII or Related Data, your PII and Related Data will continue to be governed by the Privacy Policy under which it was subject prior to those changes, unless you have been provided notice of, and have not objected to, the changes.</SUBTEXT>

When you visit our web sites, we automatically collect non PII such as IP addresses and web site usage information from you.

We do not, however, knowingly collect PII from children under the age of thirteen.

Sometimes we collect personally identifiable information from consumers in manual format or off-line, for example via a post card or subscription form. Providing detailed notice in those situations often proves impractical, so consumers will instead be provided with a short notice that describes how to obtain the full text of this Policy and other relevant information from us.

When you provide PII to us, we will make sure you are informed about the types of uses we will make of the information to the extent it is being used in a manner that differs from what is allowed pursuant to this Privacy Policy.

We may use cookies and similar tools to relate your use of our web sites to PII obtained from you or a reputable third party. For example, if you've asked us to send you information about our upcoming products or promotions, cookie and/or click stream data about your activities on our web sites may allow us to limit the materials we send you to items we think you will find interesting, based on your prior online activities and preferences. However, if we wish to combine your personal and cookie or click stream information in this manner, we will obtain your express affirmative consent.
