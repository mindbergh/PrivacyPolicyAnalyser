As is always the case, information collected and used by these Companies will not be tied to a user's personal information and will only be used in the aggregate. If you want to prevent a third-party advertiser from collecting data, currently you may visit each ad network's web site individually and opt-out or visit the NAI gateway opt-out site to opt-out of all network-advertising cookies. This site will also allow you to review the third party advertising companies.</SUBTEXT>

However, this will not include personally identifiable information about you or your usage patterns. Our advertisers allow us to provide their products and services to visitors, and in return, they will need to know how to effectively place their ads in order to attract potential customers.
Information Not Released. Surveys may ask for contact information or unique identifying information to increase the value of the results. Contests may require contact information or other demographic/ personal information in order to determine eligibility. This information will not be released to third parties without your consent.
