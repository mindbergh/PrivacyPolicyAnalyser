Your IP address is a numerical address that is used by devices connected to the Internet to identify your device so that data (such as the web pages you want to view) can be transmitted to you. We also use IP address information for systems administration (including fraud detection and prevention) and troubleshooting purposes. We may also collect information about the website you were visiting before you came to our website and the website you visit after you leave our website.

We collect personal information from you, such as your name, address, phone number, and/or e-mail address when you provide it to us in connection with a service on the Kelley Site, such as when you request a Free Dealer Price Quote, list a car for sale, answer survey questions, and register to use the community forums and/or a MyKBB account. We may also receive personal information from you when you provide it indirectly, for example when you respond to a research survey with a marketing research supplier or provide personal information with comments when you Contact Us. Once you provide Kelley with personal information, you are not anonymous to us.

When you list a car for sale, we ask for information on the car and on how you can be contacted by potential buyers (including information like your phone number and email address). We also ask for your credit card number and the expiration date on your card. We use this information to create your ad and to process your payment (please see the section on "Use and Disclosure of Information" below for more information about how we use and secure credit card information). We may also use information you submit to us in connection with your purchase of that listing, including your name and location, on third-party sites and mobile applications where we distribute or promote your listing.

Social Networks When you use one of the social network sharing tools available on our website, we and the social network operating the tool may collect information about you based on such use. The social network's use of that information will be subject to its own privacy policy, which may be different from this Privacy Statement.

Content You Post to our Website If you choose to post content to any of the interactive areas of our website, such as discussion forums, comments fields and social media areas, please keep in mind that the information you post can be seen, collected and used by anyone who has access to those areas. You may also have the opportunity from time to time to respond to questions that we display to users of the website.

We may also request your zip code. We may use either the zip code or real-time geo-location information to provide you with the content you request, such as search results of dealerships that are closest to you, or products or services we believe would be of interest to you. You can opt out of precise, real-time location-based information collection by visiting the "Settings" page of the application or by changing the location services settings on your device.</SUBTEXT>

        <SUBTITLE>How We Use the Information</SUBTITLE>
        <SUBTEXT>Kelley uses the information you provide for the following general purposes: to fulfill your requests for products and services, follow-up surveys, to contact you, to customize the content and advertising you see, to improve our services, to enforce the terms of use of the Kelley Site, and otherwise for the purposes for which you provided the information.

Kelley uses aggregate and non-personal information to conduct research and analysis and to create reports that we may provide to others, such as our business partners and customers. We may also use the non-personally identifiable information that we collect to improve the overall design and user experience of the Kelley Site, analyze trends, and administer the site.

In some cases, to provide you with a customized experience and to enhance our services, we (or third party service providers acting on our behalf) may combine information (including personally identifying information) that we collect through our website with information about you and/or your computer from other sources, including offline interactions with us, public databases, and third parties.

Kelley may use the information it collects in order to display the targeted ads about goods and services of interest to you and others ("interest-based advertising").

        <SUBTITLE>Information Sharing and Disclosure</SUBTITLE>
        <SUBTEXT>We may release or use information about our visitors when release is appropriate to comply with laws; to respond to legal process or to a valid law enforcement request; to enforce our Visitor Agreement; or to protect the rights, property or safety of visitors to our website, our customers, the public or Kelley. As our business grows, we may buy or sell various assets. In the unlikely event that Kelley, one of its business units, or substantially all of its assets is acquired by another company, information on our visitors would be among the transferred assets.

Kelley does not rent, sell, or share your personal information with other people or nonaffiliated companies except to provide products or services you've requested, when we have your permission, or under the following circumstances:

When you elect to receive information from Kelley, automobile manufacturers and local dealers and/or from Kelley's valued providers (finance, insurance, etc.), Kelley will use and/or share your personal information only as you have elected.

When you request a Free Dealer Price Quote, more information about a particular vehicle, or to be contacted by a dealer regarding a new or used vehicle, your personal information (including your contact information) may be forwarded by Kelley directly to the dealer or may be provided by Kelley to an automobile manufacturer or a trusted business partner that will forward your personal information to the dealer. Your personal information may also be forwarded by Kelley, the dealer, the automobile manufacturer or a trusted business partner to a trusted business partner or service provider, for the purpose of verifying your personal information, reviewing buyer purchase activity and reporting aggregate vehicle transaction data (excluding your personal information) to Kelley, the dealer, the automobile manufacturer, and/or a trusted business partner.

Please be aware that when you provide personal information to Kelley and authorize Kelley to share that information with a third party, your personal information becomes the property of Kelley and/or the third party. Kelley and/or the third party may use your personal information to process your request and provide valuable services. Keep in mind that once Kelley shares your personal information with a dealer or other third party as you have requested, Kelley may no longer have control over the use of the information by those third parties.

Kelley may share non-personal information about your interaction with the Kelley Site and other Web sites in order to provide interest-based ads to you and others on the Kelley Site or on other websites. Kelley and its trusted partners and third-party advertising companies may note some of the pages you visit through the use of pixel tags.

For more information on our interest-based advertising practices, click here.

When we use other companies to help us operate our website or improve the services we offer to you, we may provide them with information about our visitors that is necessary for them to perform their services. We require that these companies commit to use the information only to perform the services that we request.

If you choose to unsubscribe in response to an email message that we send on behalf of an advertiser, we will share your email address and opt-out instructions with the advertiser. Similarly, if we ask a third-party company to send its customers email offers on our behalf, we will share with that company (or its agent) a list of email addresses collected from website visitors who have opted out of our email program.

Although we take appropriate measures to protect against unauthorized disclosures of information, we cannot assure you that the information we collect will never be disclosed in a manner that is inconsistent with this privacy policy.

We may share this information with our affiliates, including AutoTrader Group, Inc. and any of their subsidiaries, so that we and they may provide you with information, products, and services that we believe may be of interest to you.

If you do not want your information to be used for marketing by Kelley and/or a third party, do not provide the information, "opt in" or otherwise agree to such use, or "opt out," as appropriate.</SUBTEXT>
