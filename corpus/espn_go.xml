        <SUBTEXT>An IP address is a number that's automatically assigned to your computer whenever you're surfing the Web. Web servers -- the big computers that "serve up" Web pages -- automatically identify your computer by its IP address.

GO Network and ESPN.com collect IP addresses for the purposes of system administration, to report aggregate information to our advertisers, and to audit the use of our site. When guests request pages from GO Network and ESPN.com sites, our servers log the guests' IP addresses. We do not normally link IP addresses to anything personally identifiable, which means that a user's session will be logged, but the user remains anonymous to us. We can and will use IP addresses to identify a user when we feel it is necessary to enforce compliance with our house rules or terms of service or to protect our service, site, customers or others.

Some services within GO Network and ESPN.com, such as certain message boards, may display IP addresses along with the message poster's name and message. Please review each service prior to use and only use those that disclose information you are comfortable with sharing.


Use of Cookies

What are cookies? Cookies are pieces of information that a Web site transfers to an individual's hard drive for record-keeping purposes. Cookies make Web-surfing easier for you by saving your preferences while you're at our site. We never save passwords or credit card information in cookies. The use of cookies is an industry standard -- you'll find them at most major Web sites.

By showing how and when guests use a site, cookies help us see which areas are popular and which are not. Many improvements and updates to the site are based on such data as total number of visitors and pages viewed. This information is most easily tracked with cookies. We use the information from cookies to provide services better tailored to our users needs.

GO Network and ESPN.com have two primary uses for its cookies. First, we use them to specify unique preferences. For example, in GO Network and ESPN.com's News Center, users can specify keywords across several news categories. This way you don't have to tell us over and over again about the kinds of news stories you want to see. Secondly, we use cookies to track user trends and patterns. This helps us better understand and improve areas of the GO Network and ESPN.com service that our users find valuable. While both of these activities depend on the use of a "cookie," visitors to GO Network and ESPN.com always have the option of disabling cookies via their browser preferences. Information from cookies is sometimes attached to messages sent to our Customer Service department

Most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies. You can reset your browser to refuse all cookies or indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, note that some parts of the GO Network and ESPN.com service will not function properly or may be considerably slower if you refuse cookies. For example, without cookies, you will not be able to set personalized news preferences or you may have difficulty completing shopping transactions, entering contests, or playing games.

You may occasionally get cookies from our advertisers. GO Network and ESPN.com do not control these cookies. The use of advertising cookies sent by third-party servers is standard in the Internet industry.

Links to other sites

Users should be aware that when you are on GO Network and ESPN.com, you could be directed to other sites that are beyond our control. There are links to other sites from GO Network and ESPN.com pages that take you outside our service. For example, if you "click" on a banner advertisement or an GO Network or ESPN.com search result, the "click" takes you off the GO Network or ESPN.com site. This includes links from advertisers, Center sponsors and partners that may use GO Network or ESPN.com's logo as part of a co-branding agreement. These other sites may send their own cookies to users, collect data or solicit personal information.

Please keep in mind that whenever you give out personal information online --- for example, via message boards or chat --- that information can be collected and used by people you don't know. While GO Network and ESPN.com strive to protect its user's personal information and privacy, we cannot guarantee the security of any information you disclose online and you do so at your own risk.

GO Network and ESPN.com's policy does not extend to anything that is inherent in the operation of the Internet, and therefore beyond GO Network and ESPN.com's control, and is not to be applied in any manner contrary to applicable law or governmental regulation.</SUBTEXT>
    </SECTION>
    <SECTION>
        <SUBTITLE>SECURITY</SUBTITLE>
        <SUBTEXT>The importance of security for all personally identifiable information associated with our guests is of utmost concern to us. We exercise great care in providing secure transmission of your information from your PC to our servers. Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we strive to protect your personal information, GO Network and ESPN.com can't ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us or from our online products or services, and you do so at your own risk. Once we receive your transmission, we make our best effort to ensure its security on our systems. When credit card information is transmitted we use industry standard, SSL (secure socket layer) encryption.

Your GO Network and ESPN.com Account is password protected so that only you can access it and view the member information relevant to the account. We recommend that you do not divulge your password to anyone. GO Network and ESPN.com will never ask you for your password in an unsolicited phone call or email. Ultimately, you are responsible for maintaining the secrecy of your passwords and any account information.

Remember to sign out of your GO Network or ESPN.com account and close your browser window when you have finished your work. This is to ensure that others cannot access your personal information and correspondence if your computer is accessible to others or if you share a computer with someone else or are using a computer in a public place like a library or internet café.</SUBTEXT>

    <SECTION>
        <SUBTITLE>YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF THESE TERMS</SUBTITLE>
        <SUBTEXT>By using this site, you signify your assent to the GO Network and ESPN.com Privacy Policy. If you do not agree to this policy, please do not use our sites. Your continued use of the GO Network and ESPN.com sites following the posting of changes to these terms will mean you accept those changes.

If you have questions or concerns regarding this Web site's privacy statement, you should first contact the company at comments@go.com If you do not receive acknowledgment of if your inquiry or your inquiry has not been satisfactorily addressed, you should then contact TRUSTe (http://www.truste.org/users/users_watchdog.html).

SAFETY TIPS

This is a great place for both new and advanced Web users to find information on using the Internet wisely.

Go Network's Internet Safety Tips

Keep your passwords private, even from your best friend! Your online service will never ask for them, so neither should anyone else.
Use only your member name and/or e-mail address when chatting or sending e-mail. Never give out personal information like your name, address, or phone number.
Always delete unknown e-mail attachments before opening them. They can contain destructive viruses.
Remember that nothing you write on the Web is completely private - including e-mail. So be careful and think about what you type and who you tell.
Not everyone is as nice, cute and funny as they may sound online. Never make plans to meet an online "friend" in person.
