        <SUBTEXT>Some forms may ask users to give us contact information (e-mail address).

    <SECTION>
        <SUBTITLE>Web Forms</SUBTITLE>
        <SUBTEXT>Many of the forms ask you to enter information for using the conversions. Such as how many feet to convert to meters. Some may ask for personal information, such as your birthday, to tell you how many days old you are. These forms use "Client Side Scripting" and do not send any information to us. The information entered in these forms disappears as soon as you close your web browser.</SUBTEXT>
    </SECTION>
    <SECTION>
        <SUBTITLE>Forums</SUBTITLE>
        <SUBTEXT>We use a community type BBS for our Message Forums.

If you post messages as a guest, your name and e-mail address is asked for. This information can be viewed by anyone. Your e-mail address is not required and we recommend not giving it, and using an alias for your name, if you do not wish this information available to the public.

If you register for the message forums, other personal information is asked for. This information is viewable by anyone. Most information is optional and we recommend not giving information you do not want available to the public. Your e-mail address is required but you can make this private in your preferences. Your name is required but you may use an alias if you wish.

Any information you give in the message forums is not used by us. It is used only for the message forum. Some examples are notifying you through e-mail when you request to be notified of new postings.</SUBTEXT>

        <SUBTITLE>Security</SUBTITLE>
        <SUBTEXT>This site has standard security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse, and alteration of the information under our control.
