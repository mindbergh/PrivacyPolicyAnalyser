        <SUBTITLE>the information we collect</SUBTITLE>
        <SUBTEXT>Whenever you shop in our stores, or at jcp.com, we obtain from you the information we need to complete your transaction. This information may include your name, address, telephone number, driver's license number, birth date, and email address.  If you use a credit or debit card or pay by check, it will include your account number.

If you register with jcp.com or sign up to receive mobile or email updates from jcpenney, we will collect the information you submit.

If you choose to use or participate in one of our various services, promotions, programs, surveys, sweepstakes or clubs, we may collect additional information about you.

From your transactions and other interactions with us, we obtain information concerning the specific products or services you purchase or use.

We may also obtain information about other people from you. For example, if you order a gift to be delivered directly to a friend, you would need to give us the friend's name and address.

We receive information from other companies. For example, if you have a jcpenney credit card, we receive application and account information from GE Capital Retail Bank (GECRB), the company that owns and administers jcpenney credit accounts (see the "your jcpenney credit account" section of this policy for additional information).

We also collect consumer information from third-party providers in order to improve the accuracy of our customer database or increase our understanding of our customers. For example, we get updated addresses from the National Change of Address (NCOA) service, licensed by the U.S. Postal Service, to assist us in having the correct addresses for our customers.

We work with certain websites to present advertising to known groups of our customers when they visit those websites. This practice, referred to as "data matching" is facilitated by a third-party service provider for jcpenney and the advertising website. This practice avoids direct sharing of any personal data with the advertising website. Data received back through this process is used to analyze the effectiveness of such advertising to groups of customers.</SUBTEXT>

contacting you about the status of your store or jcp.com orders
responding to your customer service inquiries or requests
notifying you of product recalls or providing other information concerning products you have purchased

        <SUBTITLE>information we share with others</SUBTITLE>
        <SUBTEXT>jcp family:  We share information we collect with affiliated companies and licensees (like the optical and photography departments in jcpenney retail stores) within the jcp family of businesses.
service providers:  We provide information to other companies that provide support services that help us bring you the products and services we offer, market our products and services, or process your transactions. For instance we share information with our international fulfillment service provider, FiftyOne, for the purpose of facilitating the sale and fulfillment of online purchases that our customers choose to ship internationally. We also provide information to GECRB and other service providers in connection with the jcpenney credit programs.
third-party offers:  We provide information to responsible outside companies. These carefully selected companies may use the information we share to let you know about their products or services, which may include providing special offers to you.
promotion sponsors:  If you enter a contest, sweepstakes or other promotion sponsored or co-sponsored by a third-party company, we may forward information about you to that company.
others:  On rare occasions, we may be required to disclose the information we collect pursuant to lawful requests, such as subpoenas or court orders, or in compliance with applicable laws. We may also disclose that information when we believe disclosure is appropriate to protect the rights, interests and property of jcpenney or others, and to protect the safety of customers, associates or others. This may include sharing information with other companies, attorneys, credit bureaus, agents or governmental agencies in connection with issues related to fraud, credit or debt collection. Also, if the ownership of all or part of a business within the jcp family were to change, information about customers pertinent to that business's operations would likely be transferred to, or licensed for use by, the new owner. The applicable member of the jcp family might also retain a copy of that information.</SUBTEXT>

        <SUBTEXT>Whether you are shopping online or in our stores, protecting your personal information is important to us.  We have appropriate physical, technical and procedural safeguards in place to secure the personal information we collect from you.

We limit the information we provide to outside companies to only information we believe is appropriate to enable them to carry out their responsibilities under our contracts or to offer you their products and services.  We contractually require that they have appropriate information security safeguards, and that the information provided be used only for the specifically authorized purpose.</SUBTEXT>

        <SUBTEXT>online security

Secure Socket Layering (SSL) technology is used to encrypt your credit or debit card information, including the account number, while it is transmitted over the Internet from your computer.  SSL is an industry standard technology for secure online transactions.

unauthorized charges

If unauthorized charges (as determined by your card issuer) are made on your credit or debit card as a result of purchases made on jcp.com utilizing our secure servers, jcpenney will reimburse you for up to $50 of any amounts you are required to pay by the card issuer. Also, under the Fair Credit Billing Act, your credit card provider cannot hold you liable for more than $50 of unauthorized charges on a credit card. Your liability for unauthorized use of a debit card may be higher, but many debit card issuers voluntarily apply the $50 limit to their cards as well.

Remember:  In the event of unauthorized use of your credit or debit card, you must promptly notify the card issuer pursuant to its reporting rules and procedures.</SUBTEXT>

If you register with us at jcp.com, your e-mail address is saved in your cookie. We do not store your name (unless it is part of your email address), street address or credit card number in your cookie.

However, if you block cookies you will not be able to make a purchase on jcp.com.

web beacons - A “web beacon” (also called a pixel tag or a clear gif) is a tiny graphic image placed on web site pages or in our emails that allows us to determine whether you have performed specific actions.

We use that information to analyze what our visitors like to do on our site and the effectiveness of our features and advertising, as well as interactions with our e-mail advertising. jcpenney uses service providers to assist in the collection and analysis of this information.  The service providers that assist us with our e-mail advertising may access your e-mail address through these web beacons in connection with the services they perform for us.  For example, they may look to see if you received an email message from us prior to making a purchase on jcp.com.  Our contracts with our service providers require them to limit their use of such information to the purposes authorized by us.

        <SUBTITLE>international customer privacy</SUBTITLE>
        <SUBTEXT>jcpenney has contracted with Borderfree, Inc. (“Borderfree”) to facilitate the sale and fulfillment of online purchases that our customers choose to ship internationally (an “international order”).

When you place an international order, you will submit personal information (e.g. your name, email address, billing address, and shipping address) and other order-related information to jcpenney through and to servers located in the United States.  If you also choose to create a jcp.com account, any personal information you provide will also be transferred to jcpenney through and to servers located in the United States.  Please note that United States law may not provide a level of data protection equivalent to the laws in your home country.  This privacy policy applies to any personal information you furnish jcpenney in connection with international orders, your jcp.com account or otherwise.

jcp will then share your international order information, including personal information about you, with Borderfree for the purpose of facilitating ordering and shipping internationally.  Borderfree  will process personal information about you in accordance with its privacy policy .  Borderfree has agreed not to sell, transfer, or otherwise use your information other than for processing international orders and shipments.

By placing an international order, you acknowledge and agree that jcp will transfer personal information about you to Borderfree, and acknowledge that your financial transaction and shipment will be processed by Borderfree.  During the checkout process, you will be presented with Borderfree's terms and conditions and privacy policy.  You must agree to them to receive the product(s) you ordered.

Once your order is approved, jcpenney will ship it to Borderfree.  Simultaneously, Borderfree will purchase the product(s) you ordered from us, which allows them to take title to the product(s), bill your credit card, collect and remit any duties and taxes to the appropriate taxing authorities and arrange for the product(s) to be delivered to you.  In this process, Borderfree makes the sale to you as the merchant of record.

Customers shipping internationally who wish to:

Inquire about or update their personal information,
Make a complaint about the collection or use of their personal information, or
Comment on or ask questions regarding this privacy policy,
should email us at privacy@jcpenneyeservices.com</SUBTEXT>
