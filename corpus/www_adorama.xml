        <SUBTITLE>1. Types of information we collect</SUBTITLE>
        <SUBTEXT>There are two types of information that Adorama collects online: (1) personally identifiable information supplied by visitors to our web site, and (2) non-personal information gathered as visitors navigate through the web site.

Personally Identifiable Information
Personally identifiable information is information that can be directly associated with a specific person or entity, such as name, address, or email address. Adorama collects personally identifiable information from site visitors in the following instances:

When you place an order on our site, we require you to provide your name, email address, mailing address, telephone number and credit card information.

At the time of ordering, you may also choose to register by creating a user name and password. By registering, you create a user profile which allows us to customize your experience on this web site, as well as provide a faster method for you to submit a request for information to www.adorama.com and receive back either the information or products desired.

When you voluntarily provide us with your information via a web form on our web site, or while corresponding with us via email.

It is not necessary to provide any personally identifiable information in order to simply browse our web site.


Non-Personal Information
Adorama routinely gathers non-personal information, including how many people visit this web site, the pages they visit, where they come from, how long they stay, their IP address, and the type of browser they used while visiting. None of this information is used to identify you personally.

Non-personal information is gathered through the use of cookies, web beacons and web server logs.

A cookie is a small piece of information that a web site sends to a visitor's computer and which is then stored on the visitor's hard drive.

A Web beacon is an electronic image, also known as a clear GIF or a single-pixel (1x1). Web beacons can recognize certain types of information on a visitor's computer, such as a visitor's cookie number, the time and date of a page view, and a description of the page where the Web beacon is placed. You may render some Web beacons unusable by rejecting their associated cookies.

A web server log is a file where web site activity is stored. Every time a visitor requests a file or web page an entry is made into our server logs. These files include the HTML files and their imbedded graphic images and any other associated files that are transmitted to Web site visitors. Log files can be analyzed and summarized by another program.
Although Adorama uses web server logs, web beacons, and cookies on this web site, we do not know who any visitor is unless that person specifically tells us.</SUBTEXT>

        <SUBTITLE>2. How we use your information</SUBTITLE>
        <SUBTEXT>Non-Personal Information
Adorama typically uses the non-personal information we collect in order to better understand how you and other visitors use our web site, for system administration, to confirm that you've opened the emails that we send you, and to customize your experience when using this web site. For example, we use cookies to ensure that items added to your shopping cart during one visit are accessible to you on subsequent visits until you either place an order or delete the items from the shopping cart.

Personally Identifiable Information
Adorama may share your personally identifiable information with trusted third party vendors for the sole purpose of facilitating your order. For example, we provide your name, shipping address, phone number, and order information to our shipping carrier. We also may provide your name, billing address, and credit card information to the credit card processor that facilitates the transaction. Adorama has strict guidelines requiring all third parties to keep any shared personally identifiable information confidential.

Unless otherwise required by law, or if pertinent to a judicial or governmental investigation, or as voluntarily released by you, your personally identifiable information is not shared with other organizations or persons, other than to organizations or persons assisting us in collecting, assembling or processing this information.

In the course of growing or restructuring our business, we may purchase the assets of another company or sell the assets of our company. During these transactions, information about customers is frequently considered a business asset that is the subject of such a purchase or sale. Also, in the unlikely event that Adorama, or substantially all of its assets are either acquired or subject to liquidation in bankruptcy, information may be transferred as well. We will require third parties who obtain access to your information as a result of a transaction to adhere to this privacy policy as a condition to transferring the information to them.</SUBTEXT>

        <SUBTEXT>This web site is designed for those 15 years of age and older. We will not knowingly collect information of any kind from anyone under the age of 13. If we become aware of a visitor under the age of 13 providing information on our site, we will terminate any accounts associated with that visitor and purge our databases of all information provided by that visitor.</SUBTEXT>

        <SUBTITLE>4. Access, accuracy and opt-out rights</SUBTITLE>
        <SUBTEXT>Adorama will make every effort to provide you with access to your personally identifiable information so that you may review, update or correct that information. To protect your privacy and security, we will also take reasonable steps to verify your identity before enabling you to view your data and/or make corrections. If you have submitted personally identifiable information to Adorama and would like it removed or modified, please contact us at info@adorama.com.

        <SUBTITLE>5. Security</SUBTITLE>
        <SUBTEXT>The security of your information is very important to us. Adorama follows generally accepted industry standards to protect the information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. We use state-of-the-art data encryption technology to protect against loss, misuse or alteration of your user information. Secure Socket Layers (SSLs) encrypt the information sent between your computer and our database. Our ordering system is certified by Verisign, an internet leader in security transactions. In addition, we use Internet fraud screening to protect credit card transactions.

To be sure you're browsing secure pages, check your Web browser's status bar (located at the bottom of the window) for the closed padlock icon. This icon appears in the latest versions of Internet Explorer and Netscape Navigator to tell you that you are viewing a secure web page. Also, all browsers display an "s" after the "http" (https://..) in the Web site address to indicate that you're in a secure environment.

Credit Card Fraud Warranty
We guarantee that every online transaction you make will be 100% safe. This means you pay nothing if unauthorized charges are made to your card as a result of shopping at our online store. Under the Fair Credit Billing Act, your bank generally cannot hold you liable for more than $50.00 of fraudulent charges. If your bank does hold you liable for any of this $50.00, we will cover the entire liability for you, up to the full $50.00. We will only cover this liability if the unauthorized use of your credit card resulted through no fault of your own from purchases made while using the secure server. In the event of unauthorized use of your credit card, you must notify your credit card provider in accordance with its reporting rules and procedures.

If you have any questions about security on our Web site, please contact info@adorama.com.</SUBTEXT>

        <SUBTITLE>6. Third party use of information collected on this web site</SUBTITLE>
        <SUBTEXT>The Adorama web site may contain links to other sites. We do not endorse or otherwise accept responsibility for the content or privacy policies of those sites.

Adorama may share your personally identifiable information with trusted third party vendors for the sole purpose of facilitating your order. For example, we provide your name, shipping address, phone number, and order information to our shipping carrier. We also may provide your name, billing address, and credit card information to the credit card processor that facilitates the transaction. We also may grant limited access to your name and email address to the agency that deploys emails and other marketing campaigns on our behalf for the purpose of improving our marketing outreach programs. Adorama has strict guidelines requiring all third parties to keep any shared personally identifiable information confidential.

Adorama may employ additional third parties to provide marketing services on our behalf. With our approval, these third parties may also place “cookies” onto your computer for analysis purposes. These third party companies will have access to the information needed to perform their functions but cannot use that information for any other purpose. These third party companies will only have access to non-personal information about your visit or transaction, such as the URLS which lead you to and around our web site, the pages visited, the product(s) purchased, and the amount spent. These companies will not have access to information that will allow them to personally identify you.</SUBTEXT>
