We are committed to protecting and respecting your privacy. This commitment guides our handling of any personal data we collect from you, or that you provide us with.

The location function used in our smartphone apps is only used to provide you with easy access to your current location on the map.

In the instances when you have to register for one of our services, this is to let us provide personalized services and communicate separately with you. Your information will never be shared with a third-party.

We store all user information in secure databases protected via a variety of access controls. This data is accessed only for the purposes specified in this privacy policy.

Like most web sites, we use small bits of data called cookies stored on users' computers to simulate a continuous connection. Cookies let us remember information about your preferences and passwords and allow you to move within our service without reintroducing yourself. Web browsers let you easily see and control cookies. Flightradar24 and its advertisers may also use cookies to determine on an anonymous basis, which advertisements users have seen, and how users responded to them. Similarly, Flightradar24 and its advertisers may use small pieces of code called "web beacons" or "clear gifs" to collect anonymous advertising metrics and to deliver cookies related to such advertisements.
