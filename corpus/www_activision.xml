        <SUBTITLE>What are "Cookies" and does Activision use cookies, track IP Addresses, or use other passive means to collect information</SUBTITLE>
        <SUBTEXT>Activision uses cookies on its websites and other online properties. A "cookie" is a small bit of record-keeping information that many websites and other online properties often store on a user's computer or device in order to anonymously identify it and associate activity with it. Cookies typically do not include people's names, or e-mail addresses.
When visiting our websites and other online services you can choose whether or not to let us enable cookies. We use cookies to optimize your visit, make your browsing experience as effective as possible, and let you know about offers that we think will interest you. This means that if you refuse, your use of our websites and other online properties may be impaired as a result.
Depending on the Activision website or other online property you are using, and the country you are based in, cookies may be set on your computer or device by either:
Activision - to recognize and associate activity with your computer or device when it visits an Activision website or other online property. Activision cookies cannot be used to recognize or associate activity with your computer or device when it visits other, third party websites or online properties.
Third Parties â€“ to enable third party features or functionality to be provided on or through Activision's websites or other online properties (e.g. advertising and analytics). The third parties that set these cookies can recognize your computer or device both when it visits Activision websites or other online properties in question and also when it visits certain other non-Activision websites or online properties that use the third party's features and functionality
Types Of Cookies

•    Strictly Necessary Cookies
These cookies are essential in order to enable you to move around websites or online properties and use their features, such as accessing secure areas of a website. Without these cookies, services you have asked for, like secure login areas, cannot be provided.
•    Performance (or Analytics) Cookies
These cookies collect information about how visitors use a website or online property, for instance which pages visitors go to most often, and if they get error messages from web pages. These cookies donâ€™t collect information that identifies a visitor. All information these cookies collect is aggregated and therefore anonymous. They are only used to improve how a website or other online property works. We generally contract with independent research and measurement companies, such as Google Analytics, to provide these services on our behalf and which may also be subject to their own privacy policies.
•    Functionality Cookies
These cookies allow the website or online property to remember choices you make (such as your user name, language or the region you are in) and provide enhanced, more personal features. These cookies can also be used to remember changes you have made to text size, fonts and other parts of web pages that you can customize. They may also be used to provide services you have asked for such as watching a video. The information these cookies collect may be anonymized and they cannot track your browsing activity on other websites.
•    Advertising Cookies
o    These cookies are used to deliver adverts more relevant to you and your interests. They are also used to limit the number of times you see an advertisement as well as help measure the effectiveness of the advertising campaign. They are usually placed by advertising networks with the website or online property operatorâ€™s permission. They remember that you have visited a website and this information is shared with other organizations such as advertisers. Quite often advertising cookies will be linked to site functionality provided by the other organization. In certain countries our websites may partner with third party online advertising and analytics companies to tailor and deliver advertisements, products, services, and promotions on our websites and other online properties, as well as advertisements, products, services, and promotions on websites and other online properties which we do not control. To help select the ads of greatest interest to you, these companies may use cookies, Flash technology, and similar technologies to collect and track non-personal information such as demographic information (e.g., gender, occupation, etc.), aggregated information, search keywords, geo-location and online data (for example, clickstream data such as browser type, language, IP address, time/date) to select advertisements that are more relevant to your interests, to better personalize the experience for you and tailor advertisements. In some instances, we may allow third-party companies to collect certain anonymous information when you visit our website. These companies may use non-personally identifiable information during your visits to this and other websites in order to provide third party advertisements about goods and services likely to be of greater interest to you. These companies typically use a cookie or a third party web beacon to collect this information.
