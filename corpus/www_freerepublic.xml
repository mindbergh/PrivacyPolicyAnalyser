        <SUBTITLE>Information Shared Outside the Verizon Family of Companies</SUBTITLE>
        <SUBTEXT>Except as explained in this Privacy Policy, in privacy policies for specific services, or in agreements with our customers, Verizon does not sell, license or share information that individually identifies our customers, people using our networks, or website visitors with others outside the Verizon family of companies for non-Verizon purposes without the consent of the person whose information will be shared.

Verizon uses vendors and partners for a variety of business purposes such as to help us offer, provide, repair and bill for services we deliver to you. We share information with those vendors and partners to the extent reasonably necessary for them to perform work on our behalf. For example, we may provide your credit card information and billing address to our payment processing company solely for the purpose of processing payment for a transaction you have requested. We require that these vendors and partners protect the customer information we may provide to them and limit their use of Verizon customer data to the purposes for which it was provided. We do not permit these types of vendors and partners to use this information for their own marketing purposes.

As described in more detail in other sections of this policy, Verizon also may share certain information with outside companies to assist with the delivery of advertising campaigns, or preparing and sharing aggregate business and marketing reports.

Verizon provides the names, addresses and telephone numbers of wireline telephone subscribers to directory publishers and directory assistance services unless a non-published or non-listed phone number has been requested.

We may disclose information that individually identifies our customers or identifies customer devices in certain circumstances, such as: • to comply with valid legal process including subpoenas, court orders or search warrants, and as otherwise authorized by law; • in cases involving danger of death or serious physical injury to any person or other emergencies; • to protect our rights or property, or the safety of our customers or employees; • to protect against fraudulent, malicious, abusive, unauthorized or unlawful use of or subscription to our products and services and to protect our network, services, devices and users from such use; • to advance or defend against complaints or legal claims in court, administrative proceedings and elsewhere; • to credit bureaus or collection agencies for reporting purposes or to obtain payment for Verizon-billed products and services; • to a third-party that you have authorized to verify your account information; • to outside auditors and regulators; or • with your consent.

Well, in their defense it does appear they were under a (debatably)lawful subpoena.

What is missing is who they will not share details with. As written there are innumerable exceptions. It would be interesting to hear from a lawyer as to exactly how much privacy they are actually offering.

A couple days ago, I went to some website with a news story about this. When I clicked on a video there, about Verizon sharing TMI with the government, it started with an ad for The Verizon Share Everything Plan. Now, wouldn't you think they would at least pull those ads from news coverage about the illegal sharing of everything? WTF?

How could they possibly think it was legal? Has mankind devolved that far already?

Yep, authorized. Not necessarily required. They promise to share whatever they are legally allowed to share, with whoever they are legally allowed. Unless they aren't legally allowed, in which case they'll do it illegally. Sign here.

It is just legalese for “CYA” as in “Cover Your Arse”

“as otherwise authorized by law”
Yeah that pretty much covers EVERYTHING....
Except you (and they) forget that the Constitution is the Supreme Law, and it prohibits warrantless search (the 4th amendment is explicit that a warrant is needed for any search or seizure); therefore, any 'legal authorization' other than a warrant "particularly describing" what is to be searched is null and void.
