        <SUBTITLE>Information We Collect by Automated Means</SUBTITLE>
        <SUBTEXT>When you visit our Sites, we may collect certain information by automated means, using technologies such as cookies, Web server logs and Web beacons.

Cookies are small files that websites send to your computer or other Internet-connected device to uniquely identify your browser or to store information or settings in your browser. Your browser may tell you how to be notified when you receive certain types of cookies and how to restrict or disable certain cookies. Please note, however, that without cookies you may not be able to use all of the features of our Sites.

Our Web servers may log information such as your device and operating system type, browser type, domain, device ID, and other system settings, as well as the language your system uses and the country and time zone where your device is located. The Web server logs also may record information such as the address of the Web page that referred you to our Site and the IP address of the device you use to connect to the Internet.

To control which Web servers collect information by automated means, we may place tags on our Web pages called "Web beacons", which are small files that allow us to understand the actions of visitors to our Sites, and we use similar technology to analyze users' interactions with our Mobile Apps.

We use third-party Web analytics services on our Sites, such as those of Omniture and Google Analytics. These service providers use cookies and Web beacons or other technology to help us analyze how users use the Sites. The information collected by such technology (including, where applicable, your IP address) will be disclosed to these service providers, who use the information to facilitate the evaluation of your use of the Sites. Learn more about Omniture's services, including your opt-out options for the Omniture tools on our websites. Learn about Google Analytics and how to opt out.</SUBTEXT>

        <SUBTEXT>On our websites, information may be collected about your online activities for use in providing you with advertising about products and services tailored to your individual interests. This section of our Privacy Notice provides details and explains how to exercise your choices.

You may see certain ads on our and other websites because we participate in advertising networks. Ad networks allow us to target our messaging to users through demographic, interest-based, and contextual means. These networks track your online activities over time by collecting information through automated means, including through the use of cookies, web server logs, and web beacons, as described in the Information We Collect by Automated Means section above. The networks use this information to show you advertisements that may be tailored to your individual interests. The information our ad networks may collect includes information about your visits to websites that participate in the relevant advertising networks, such as the pages or advertisements you view and the actions you take on the websites. This data collection takes place both on our websites and on third-party websites that participate in the ad networks. For some campaigns, this information may be combined with other information we collect about you. This process also helps us track the effectiveness of our marketing efforts. Learn how to opt out of this ad network interest-based advertising.</SUBTEXT>

        <SUBTITLE>Information We Share</SUBTITLE>
        <SUBTEXT>We may share personal information we collect on our Sites with our service providers who perform services on our behalf. These service providers are not authorized by us to use or disclose the information except as necessary to perform services on our behalf or comply with legal requirements. We may also share certain personal information among our affiliates and joint marketing partners for the purposes described in this Privacy Notice, including for their marketing purposes.

We may share personal information with authorized operators of websites and applications that interact with our systems if you choose to use their applications to interact with us or if you otherwise authorize those operators to access our record of your personal information. For example, if you log in through an authorized third-party mobile app that allows you to view your Mileage Plan™ account, we may share personal information with the operator of the mobile app. Such operators' use of the information may be subject to their own privacy policies, which we strongly recommend you review before logging in through their applications. We are not responsible for such operators' privacy practices, which are not covered by this Privacy Notice.

We also may disclose information about you (i) if we are required to do so by law or legal process, (ii) to law enforcement authorities, or (iii) when we believe disclosure is necessary or appropriate to prevent harm or loss or in connection with an investigation of suspected or actual illegal activity.

As mandated by the U.S. government and governments outside the U.S., Alaska Airlines will provide to those governments specific passenger information collected on our Sites for travelers crossing international borders. For flights within the U.S., and pursuant to the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) Secure Flight Program, Alaska Airlines is required to collect and transmit the following passenger information: Name, Birth Date, Gender and Redress Number, if available, to the TSA. For information from the TSA about its privacy practices, please visit www.tsa.gov.

We also reserve the right to transfer personal information we have about you in the event we sell or transfer all or a portion of our business or assets. Should such a sale or transfer occur, we will use reasonable efforts to direct the transferee to use personal information you have provided to us in a manner that is consistent with our Privacy Notice.</SUBTEXT>
