        <SUBTEXT>At Udacity ("Udacity", "we", "us", "our") we respect your privacy rights. We have created this privacy policy ("Privacy Policy") to explain how we treat the information collected and received from your use of our websites, "http:// www.udacity.com", "http://www.knowlabs.com", and "http://www.ai-class.com" (each, a "Website" and collectively, the "Websites"). This Privacy Policy applies only to the Websites, and we are not responsible for the practices of persons, companies, institutions or websites that Udacity does not control, manage, or employ. Except as set forth in this Privacy Policy and our Terms of Use Agreement ("Terms of Use") and other published guidelines, we do not release personal information about our users without their permission.</SUBTEXT>

        <SUBTITLE>What Information this Privacy Policy Covers</SUBTITLE>
        <SUBTEXT>Some of our Website's functionality can be used without revealing any personal information, though for features or services related to the online courses, personal information is required. If you do not use these specific features or services on the Website, then the only information we collect will be "Non-Personal Information" (i.e., information that cannot be used to identify you). Non-Personal Information includes information such as the web pages that you have viewed. In order to access certain features and benefits on our Website, you may need to submit "Personally Identifiable Information" (i.e., information that can be used to identify you). Personally Identifiable Information can include information such as your name and email address, among other things. You are responsible for ensuring the accuracy of the Personally Identifiable Information you submit to Udacity. Inaccurate information may affect your ability to use the Website, the information you receive when using the Website, and our ability to contact you. For example, your email address should be kept current because that is one of the primary manners in which we communicate with you.</SUBTEXT>

    <SECTION>
        <SUBTITLE>What Information We Collect</SUBTITLE>
        <SUBTEXT>We gather two types of information about users through the Website:

NON-PERSONAL INFORMATION

When users come to our Website, we may track, collect and aggregate Non-Personal Information indicating, among other things, which pages of our Website were visited, the order in which they were visited, when they were visited, and which hyperlinks were "clicked." We also collect information from the URLs from which you linked to our Website. Collecting such information may involve logging the IP address, operating system and browser software used by each user of the Website. Although such information is not Personally Identifiable Information, we may be able to determine from an IP address a user's Internet Service Provider and the geographic location of his or her point of connectivity.

We also use or may use cookies and/or web beacons to help us determine and identify repeat visitors, the type of content and sites to which a user of our Website links, the length of time each user spends at any particular area of our Website, and the specific functionalities that users choose to use. Essentially, cookies are a user's identification card for the Udacity servers. Web beacons are small graphic files linked to our servers that allow us to track your use of our Website and related functionalities. Cookies and web beacons allow Udacity to serve you better and more efficiently, and to personalize your experience at our Website. Cookies and web beacons are not used to retain Personally Identifiable Information. From time to time we may also use additional typical methods of collecting data.

You should be able to control how and whether cookies will be accepted by your web browser. Most browsers offer instructions on how to reset the browser to reject cookies in the "Help" section of the toolbar. If you reject our cookies, many functions and conveniences of this Website may not work properly.

PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION

We collect Personally Identifiable Information that you provide to us when you sign-up for email updates or online courses, participate in our public forums, send us email messages, and/or participate in online courses or receive other services on or through our Website. Among other things, we may use the Personally Identifiable Information that you provide to respond to your questions, provide you the specific course and/or services you select, send you updates about online courses offered by Udacity or other Udacity events, and send you email messages about Website maintenance or updates, among other things.

UPDATES

Udacity may offer you the ability to receive updates either via email or by posting on portions of the Website only accessible to registered users. In order to subscribe to these services, you may be required to provide us with Personally Identifiable Information such as your name and email address.

FORUMS

Udacity may offer public forums from time to time (the "Forums") where you can share comments and thoughts. In order to participate in the Forums, you may be required to register with us and/or provide us with Personally Identifiable Information such as your name and email address. "Personally Identifiable Information" shall not include any information posted or sent by or to you via any public Forum.

PARTICIPATION IN ONLINE COURSES

From time to time, Udacity may offer you the opportunity to participate in an online course on or through the Website. If you desire to participate in a course, you will be asked to provide us with certain information necessary to conduct such a course. This information may include, among other things, your name and email address. Udacity, or its third party service providers, may, for instance, collect certain information from you in conjunction with assignments, exams and other assessments related to the online course. For example, as part of a proctored exam for a course, Udacity (or its third party service providers) may collect certain information from you in order to (a) verify or authenticate your identity or submissions made by you, such as a signature for a test or assignment log, a photograph or recording of you (e.g., using a webcam) or information included on a photo identification card or document, or (b) monitor your performance during an exam to confirm that you are abiding by the applicable test rules or requirements (e.g., confirming that you are not using prohibited resources). Udacity may also collect information from you or about your performance or accomplishments related to the course, such as quiz/exam scores, grades, project evaluations, teacher evaluations and other evaluations of your performance or accomplishments.

For example, as part of a proctored exam or exit interview for the course, Udacity may use certain information collected from you in order to verify your identity, or to monitor your performance during the exam to confirm that you are abiding by the applicable testing rules or requirements. We may share Personally Identifiable Information that we collect from you when you participate in an online course with the particular educational partner (e.g., such as a university or company) that developed or offered the online course and the instructor(s) who taught, managed or otherwise oversaw the course. For example, if you are taking a course through a university, we may share Personally Identifiable Information about you and your performance with the university to report on your progress in the course. In another example, if you are taking a course sponsored or paid for by your employer, we may share your grades, evaluations, or progress in the course with your employer and other Personally Identifiable Information. This information may be shared at any time during the course or afterwards. Personally Identifiable Information shared with our educational partners will be subject to the privacy policies and procedures of such partners.
