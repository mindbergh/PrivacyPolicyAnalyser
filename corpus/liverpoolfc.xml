        <SUBTEXT>Keeping your information secure is very important to us. Your data will be held within the European Union and all reasonable measures to protect and safeguard your data in accordance with applicable data protection law will be taken. Please note that we cannot guarantee that any data transmission over the internet is completely secure.
To help us provide you with information relating to products and services that we think you will be interested in your data may occasionally be processed and held by third parties outside the European Economic Area (EU). If this is the case we will put in place appropriate safeguards to ensure your data is secure and protected in accordance with applicable data protection law.
Please be aware that all open interactive areas (such as The Kop, Messages Board, comments etc) are accessible to all users and their contents effectively available in the public domain. Think carefully about the contents of your submissions and if you choose to make a submission containing your personal information you do so at your own risk.
Protecting the online privacy of children is especially important. If we reasonably believe a user of interactive area to be under 13 years of age, we may need to remove any personal details gathered from such a user and, where possible, all submissions.</SUBTEXT>
