        <SUBTEXT>EWG'S PRIVACY POLICY
Updated September 2011


The Environmental Working Group will automatically add you to our database of supporters when you participate in any EWG or EWG Action Fund campaign. If you do not wish to be on EWG's list, you may unsubscribe at any time, and we will make that option easily and readily available. EWG will never sell your e-mail address or other contact information.

If we wish to use supporters' personally identifiable information in a manner different from that stated at the time of collection, we will notify supporters via email. Supporters will have a choice as to whether or not we use their information in this different manner.
