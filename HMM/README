1. 'initTrainData.m' takes in 'XTrain'file and 'LabeledVol.txt'file, and initiate model parameters;
    Then it stores all the generated vars in 'TrainMat.mat'file;

2. 'EM_estimate.m' takes in the vars in 'TrainMat.mat'file, and execute to train the HMM Model;
    a, b, p is the final HMM model parameters;

REMAINS to be done: Viterbi to decode states transitions
                    cluster the sections
