        <SUBTITLE>What Information We Collect</SUBTITLE>
        <SUBTEXT>Information you provide. You are not required to create a Lumosity account to gain access to many areas of Lumosity. If you do create an account, we ask for certain information to process your registration, including an email address and password. If you subscribe to a paid account, we request additional information, including your full name and payment method details.

To help personalize your experience, we also ask for certain, limited demographic information, including your first name, gender, date of birth and education level. Providing most of this information is optional. We also allow you to upload a photo of yourself and select your preferences for training, language, and receiving email communications.

If you sign in to Lumosity using your Facebook or other third party credentials, we will use that service to authenticate you. We may also collect other information that you have agreed may be provided by that third party, such as your username, name, e-mail address, date of birth and gender. We collect this information so that it can be used for the purposes explained in this Policy.

We may supplement the information you provide to us with additional information gathered from other sources, such as publicly available information.

Data we collect. In addition to the information you provide to us, when you use Lumosity, we may also automatically collect and store information about the computer, mobile device, or other devices you use to access Lumosity and about how you use Lumosity. For example, we collect and store data about the games you play and your performance in those games. We may also collect and store information such as your browser type, IP address, language, operating system, unique device identifier, the date and time of your visit, the pages you view and the websites you visited immediately before and after visiting Lumosity.

Our use of cookies. To collect information, we use cookies and other standard web technologies (e.g., pixel tags). Cookies are small text files placed on the browser of your computer or mobile device when you visit a website that collect non-personal information. We use “persistent cookies” to save your login information for future logins to Lumosity. We use “session ID cookies” to enable certain features of Lumosity, to better understand how you interact with the Service and to monitor aggregate usage and web traffic routing on the Service. Most browsers automatically accept cookies, but allow you to disable cookies through the “options” or “preferences” menu of your browser. Please be aware that disabling cookies could interfere with the functionality of Lumosity.

Third parties whose products or services are accessible in Lumosity, including social networking services like Facebook, may also use cookies or similar tools. Please review their privacy policies for information about their cookies and other privacy practices.

The third-party advertising and analytics companies with whom we or our advertisers partner, including Google and New Relic, may place a unique cookie or utilize similar technologies on your browser in order to collect non-personal information about your visits to Lumosity. If you would like more information about this practice and how to control how this information is used by these companies, please visit the following links:

        <SUBTITLE>How We Use Your Information at Lumos Labs</SUBTITLE>
        <SUBTEXT>We use the information we collect to operate and provide you with Lumosity. This includes, but is not limited to:
Authenticating your login and processing your payments;
Personalizing your Lumosity experience and customizing your training program;
Allowing you to monitor your performance and progress in Lumosity, by, for example, presenting charts and graphs of your performance to you;
Customizing and delivering information about our products and services by email;
Providing customer service and sending confirmations about your account;
Protecting our intellectual property or other rights; and
Managing and improving our business, our games, and our training.

You can opt out of receiving most emails by navigating to your Email Notifications page, but we reserve the right to email you to confirm transactions or to address account issues, such as when you make a purchase, or you request a reset password.

We also reserve the right to use non-personal information (e.g., de-identified or aggregate data) for any purpose. For example, we show aggregate performance measures to users to allow them to evaluate their performance against other Lumosity users. Also, in connection with our Human Cognition Project, we may disclose performance statistics to university collaborators to evaluate, study, and improve the effectiveness of our programs or human cognition more generally. In these situations, all data is disclosed either in aggregate form or with information that can identify you removed. In addition, when we work with university collaborators, we contractually prohibit them from attempting to re-identify individuals from data that has been de-identified.</SUBTEXT>

Affiliates. We may share your information with our corporate affiliates, such as entities under common ownership or control.
Business transfers. We may sell, transfer, or otherwise share some or all of our assets in connection with a merger, reorganization, business transaction, or in the event of bankruptcy.

Compliance with law and law enforcement requests, and protection of our rights. We may disclose your information when we have a good faith belief we are required to do so by law, or in response to a subpoena, court order, or other legal mechanism. We may also disclose your information when we have a good faith belief that disclosure may prevent fraud and abuse of Lumosity or its users or protect our property rights.
Consent. We may disclose your information when we believe we have your consent to do so, such as when you contact customer service and ask us about your account, or when we have the consent of someone we believe is authorized to consent on behalf of you, such as the individual associated with the payment method for your account. If you have expressly agreed to participate in a research study with us or with a third party that incorporates your personal information collected by Lumosity, we also may disclose your information for the purpose of facilitating the research to which you have consented.</SUBTEXT>
