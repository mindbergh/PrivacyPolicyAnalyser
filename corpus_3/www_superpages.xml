        <SUBTITLE>What information does This Website gather</SUBTITLE>
        <SUBTEXT>When you visit This Website, SuperMedia may collect the following types of information:

Personally Identifiable Information You Knowingly Provide
Information SuperMedia Collects Automatically
Non-Personally Identifiable Information You Knowingly Provide
Personally Identifiable Information You Knowingly Provide. SuperMedia collects personally identifiable information that you knowingly provide to us. For example, SuperMedia may ask you to provide personally identifiable contact information (such as name, address, e-mail address and telephone number). If you purchase a product or service, SuperMedia may ask you to provide additional information such as your credit card information. If you register for the SuperGuarantee® Program, SuperMedia will ask you to provide additional information about any service appointment you register and may track your searches and any registrations, claims and ratings/reviews you file on This Website. If you file a claim under the SuperGuarantee® Program or apply for the Superpages LocalServe® Program, SuperMedia may ask you to provide additional information such as your Social Security number. If you request information relating to the sale or purchase of a vehicle on This Website, we may ask you to provide personally identifiable contact information and information relating to the vehicle. Finally, in some cases (for example, if you register with us or sign-in on This Website or purchase a product or service) SuperMedia may also ask you to provide other information such as a personal ID, password, security question and answer, and birthday.

If you choose to use an available referral service on This Website (e.g., to send a postcard, listing, page link, contest invitation, etc.), we will ask for certain personal information from the recipient (e.g., the recipient's name, e-mail address, mobile telephone number) and your name and e-mail address. SuperMedia uses the personally identifiable referral information you provide to facilitate this communication on a one-time basis, and may also store and use such personally identifiable information for analysis purposes (e.g., tracking the success of the referral feature).

You are responsible for the accuracy and completeness of all personally identifiable information that you knowingly provide.

Information Automatically Collected. In addition, as you (and other users) browse This Website, our web servers, and non “SuperMedia Family” companies with which SuperMedia has an agreement may, automatically collect and track certain information about such visits, usually through the use of browser cookies, JavaScript files and tagging, web address tracking codes, file impression counts, "web beacons", and the analysis of http headers (“Tracking Methods”). These Tracking Methods provide information such as the user's IP address, the user's domain name, the user's browser type, the user's user agent, how many users visit This Website, which pages the user visits and for how long, the date and time the user accesses This Website, the Internet address of the site from which the user directly linked to This Website and the links on This Website on which the user clicks. In addition, SuperMedia may collect certain search parameters relating to searches conducted by the user which are not entered by the user.

Non-Personally Identifiable Information You Knowingly Provide. In some cases, we may also collect non-personally identifiable information that you provide, such as search parameters in connection with a search you conduct through This Website, ratings and reviews, and zip code.

To improve the services we can offer you, we may decide to expand This Website's capabilities for obtaining information about users in the future. We will update this Privacy Policy as our practices change to ensure that you are aware of developments in this area.</SUBTEXT>

    <SECTION>
        <SUBTITLE>How does SuperMedia use information collected on This Website</SUBTITLE>
        <SUBTEXT>Specific Purpose. When users supply personally identifiable information about themselves for a specific purpose (for example, to register to use a feature on This Website, to purchase a product or service, to obtain a free listing, to register for a program or to use a feature of a program, to receive information, or to apply for a job), we may use such information for such purpose.

Similar to Information Collected in Traditional Non-Electronic Manner. We also may use personally identifiable information users provide as we would use the same information obtained in a traditional non-electronic manner. For example, we may use such personally identifiable information to assess your credit rating, to publish your name, address, and phone number in our directories (unless you have requested a non-published number), to contact you in connection with a program you are participating in, user reviews and/or to evaluate your service needs, and to contact you regarding additional services you may find useful. When users provide personally identifiable information in connection with a feature on This Website, we may also use such personally identifiable information in connection with the operation of such feature. (For example, if you register to use the personalized directory service, we may use the personally identifiable information you provide to provide you with a more personalized and useful service, and if you create a review of a business on This Website, we may publish your initials, city and state in connection with such review.) When users provide personally identifiable information in connection with a contest, sweepstakes or other promotion that we may run on This Website, we may use such information to administer such contest, sweepstakes or promotion and to notify winners.

Communicate with You. We may also use personally identifiable information you provide or that is automatically collected to communicate with you (e.g., to send you e-mails) and to otherwise serve you. For example, we may use your name and e-mail address to send you e-mails to (a) provide information regarding our company, marketing information about our products and services or the products and services of other companies, and newsletters, (b) conduct online surveys, (c) confirm your registration on This Website, a service registration, or orders placed online and (d) otherwise communicate with you. However, you may request not to receive (i.e., "opt-out" of receiving) commercial e-mail messages (the primary purpose of which is the commercial advertisement or promotion of a commercial product or service) from us (on a category-by-category basis), by clicking on Update Your Email Preferences (or otherwise visiting the e-mail campaign opt-out page), and following the directions provided on the e-mail campaign opt-out page. If you have previously opted out of receiving commercial e-mail messages related to one or more categories, you may cancel your request to opt-out of (i.e., consent to receive commercial e-mail messages from us related to) such categories (on a category-by-category basis) by clicking on Update Your Email Preferences (or otherwise visiting the e-mail campaign opt-out page), and following the directions provided on the e-mail campaign opt-out page. Please note that we reserve the right to send certain types of e-mail messages that are not subject to opt-out (see information about e-mails, below) to online users, including those who have opted out of receiving commercial e-mail messages. Your personally identifiable information may also be used by non-“SuperMedia Family” companies, with which we have agreements, to provide you information about their products and services.

Protect SuperMedia's Property or Other Rights.In addition, SuperMedia may use personally identifiable information you provide and information SuperMedia automatically collects through this website (and may combine personally identifiable information you provide with information SuperMedia automatically collects through This Website and non-personally identifiable information you knowingly provide) as it deems appropriate to protect its property or other rights (for example, to enforce any policies or contractual provisions regarding use of the "ratings and reviews" feature or the "send a listing" feature).

Improve Website and Targeted Advertising. We use information SuperMedia automatically collects through This Website to improve This Website, to monitor its performance, to make This Website easier for you and other users to use, to manage features and programs made available through This Website and to provide behavioral tracking data to non-“SuperMedia Family” companies, with which we have agreements, for the purpose of presenting you with, among other things, targeted advertising on third party websites.

If you provide personally identifiable information to us in the context of an event SuperMedia sponsors on This Website with another company, such as a contest, or if you register on a co-sponsored section or feature of This Website, you may also be providing such personally identifiable information to the co-sponsor. When you provide your personally identifiable information to any third party, SuperMedia is not responsible for any third party's use of such personally identifiable information.

Information Automatically Collected.

You can tell if you have linked from one site to another site by looking at the URL in the browser window (or, if the link opens a new browser window, by looking at the URL found by "right-clicking" on the page in the window and selecting "properties"). If the second level domain of the URL for the page containing the link is different than the second level domain of the URL for the page to which you have linked, you have linked to a different site.

If you provide personally identifiable information while visiting any SuperMedia-Hosted Website Ad, you will also be providing the personally identifiable information to the advertiser (and advertiser and/or SuperMedia may be automatically collecting information while you visit any SuperMedia-Hosted Website Ad). In addition, SuperMedia may share information which is automatically collected while you visit any SuperMedia-Hosted Website Ad with non-"SuperMedia Family" companies in order to complete a transaction that you initiated or to assess and report the results of the ad. SuperMedia is not responsible for the privacy practices employed by the advertiser.

        <SUBTITLE>Cookies</SUBTITLE>
        <SUBTEXT>What is a cookie and why does SuperMedia use them?

A cookie is a small data string our server writes to your hard drive that contains your unique User ID for This Website. Cookies help us to identify new and returning users to This Website, analyze click-stream data, and track historical activity on This Website, which allows us to give you a more personalized, useful experience on This Website. Cookies may be placed by us, by a third-party that provides services to us, or a non-“SuperMedia Family” company, with which we have an agreement.

Cookies help SuperMedia to enhance the user's online experience and can be used to:

deliver the appropriate geographic message
manage frequency of ad exposure; avoid over delivery of the same message
tailor an advertisement or other content to better match your interests and preferences
ensure that you see the correct products and pricing applicable to the state in which you live
keep track of your order as you order services
understand advertising effectiveness
manage features and programs made available through This Website
collect anonymous traffic data
A cookie cannot be used to access or otherwise compromise the data on your hard drive. However, customers are free to delete website cookies. Most internet browsers enable you to erase cookies from your computer hard drive, block all cookies, or receive a warning before a cookie is stored.

You can choose to change your browser settings to disable cookies if you do not want us to establish and maintain a unique User ID. Please be aware that cookies may be required to complete certain functions on This Website, such as ordering products or services, and, also in connection with personalized sections of This website, for example My Superpages. To disable cookies, see "Setting Cookie Preferences", below.  To opt-out of the placement of behavioral tracking cookies, see “How to Opt-out of Behavior Tracking Cookies” below.

However, you need to understand that some websites/ad serving companies have the ability to reestablish your history even after cookie deletion, if you reenter the same site on another occasion, or some other site tracked by the ad serving company/network, and specifically provide personal data.

Deletion of cookies alone does not prevent ad serving companies from reestablishing history on a user. The user must either continue to decline cookies each time it reenters the site to keep the tracking severed, if desired, or opt-out. When you opt-out, your unique user ID cookie is erased and you are reassigned an anonymous, non-id cookie. This new cookie tells websites that you have opted out and they will then know not to attempt to assign other cookies to you in the future. Opt-out cookies do not contain a unique user ID number therefore websites are not able to identify your computer uniquely.

Users who choose to continually delete cookies and not opt out can have their browser advise them each time a website attempts to send a cookie to your system. At that time, you can choose to either Accept or Cancel a cookie. Users who choose to "opt out" after deleting cookies will receive an anonymous/non personally identifiable cookie.
