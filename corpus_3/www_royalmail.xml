        <SUBTITLE>How you can help keep your information secure online</SUBTITLE>
        <SUBTEXT>There is a lot that you can do to help keep your information safe - not just on our website, but whenever you provide information online.

Here are some simple ways you can improve the security of your information.

Use a strong password

Read our advice on choosing a strong password. This will help you choose a password that will be difficult for other people to guess but easy for you to remember.

Use a secure password hint

Do not make your password hint the same as your password! Your password hint should not give away your password to someone you know well, for example 'my road' or 'my dog's name'.

Keep your password private and secure

Your password is a key to your personal information and online identity. Don't tell anyone your password or write it down. If you are concerned that somebody else knows your password, you can change it on our website by going to the Edit Your Profile page. We recommend that you change your password from time to time.

Use a secure browser

Modern browsers are more secure than older versions, so always keep your browser up to date. If you browse with Internet Explorer, set Windows to update itself automatically to keep your private data safe.
