        <SUBTITLE>Information Collection and Use</SUBTITLE>
        <SUBTEXT>As a ValueClick Company, ValueClick Media is the sole owner of the information collected on this site. Information collected is in two distinct categories: Member information and aggregated Web User information. This portion of ValueClick Media's privacy statement applies only to Members of ValueClick Media. For web user privacy issues regarding the serving of advertisements and the use of cookies, please see the Web User Privacy Statement.

Members of the ValueClick Media Network include publishers and advertisers involved in advertising campaign transactions. Member information collected includes personally identifiable information that is necessary to conduct business, such as name, phone number, and email address. Payments made to and from ValueClick Media require the collection of personally identifiable information that may include credit card numbers and bank account information. Phone numbers may be used to contact Members for sales or inventory acquisition purposes. All Member information is collected, modified and stored in a password protected environment. This information is used for service, media delivery, contact, billing and accounts payable purposes. We will not sell, share, or rent this information to non-ValueClick entities. All Member information collection is explicit, voluntary, manually entered by the Member, and can be opted-out.

Cookies are used to simplify Member login and to facilitate secure navigation through the password protected areas of the website. Members who choose to reject all cookies may have difficulty navigating the password protected areas of the website depending on the nature of their connection (dynamic IP, proxy server, etc.).</SUBTEXT>

The security of Member information is crucial to our success in the highly competitive field of online advertising. ValueClick Media may, from time to time, use "gallery" pages to identify Publishers and Advertisers by business identity ONLY (e.g. Adcycle.com is a new Member of the ValueClick Media Network).</SUBTEXT>

        <SUBTITLE>DATA PROCESSING/SAFE HARBOR</SUBTITLE>
        <SUBTEXT>FOR EUROPEAN UNION AND SWISS CITIZENS

The European Union ("EU") maintains strict privacy laws. These rules differ significantly from the laws of the United States of America (“U.S.”). To reconcile these differences, the US and the EU have created a safe harbor (“U.S.-EU Safe Harbor Framework”) that defines mutually acceptable privacy operations. The U.S. and Switzerland have created a similar safe harbor (“U.S.-Swiss Safe Harbor Framework”). For more information see www.export.gov/safeharbor.

ValueClick Media complies with the U.S.-EU and US-Swiss Safe Harbor Frameworks as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal information from European Union member countries and Switzerland.  We have certified that we adhere to the Safe Harbor Privacy Principles of notice, choice, onward transfer, security, data integrity, access, and enforcement.  To learn more about the Safe Harbor program, and to view the company's certification, please visit http://www.export.gov/safeharbor/.

In compliance with the U.S.-EU and U.S.-Swiss Safe Harbor Privacy Principles, we commit to resolve complaints about your privacy and our collection or use of your personal information. European Union or Swiss citizens with inquiries or complaints regarding this privacy policy should first fill out our Feedback Form.

ValueClick Media has further committed to refer unresolved privacy complaints under the U.S.-EU and U.S.-Swiss Safe Harbor Privacy Principles to an independent dispute resolution mechanism, the BBB EU SAFE HARBOR, operated by the Council of Better Business Bureaus. Thus, if you do not receive timely acknowledgment of your complaint, or if your complaint is not satisfactorily addressed by ValueClick Media, please visit the BBB EU SAFE HARBOR website at www.bbb.org/us/safe-harbor-complaints for more information and to file a complaint.</SUBTEXT>
