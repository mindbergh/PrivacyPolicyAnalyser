        <SUBTITLE>INFORMATION WE COLLECT</SUBTITLE>
        <SUBTEXT>A. Online Advertising

Mediaplex offers Clients various online advertising products, including without limitation, MOJO Adserver, MOJO Publisher, and MOJO SEM. In the process of providing online advertising, Mediaplex does not collect any personally identifiable data, which is data collected with an intention to identify and contact a person such as name, address, telephone number or e-mail address ("PII") from Internet users with respect to such online advertising products. We may use technology such as click-stream, cookies, web beacons, log files and HTTP protocol elements to collect general data on the performance of our advertising campaigns so we can report aggregated results. This data is collected on an anonymous and non-personally identifiable basis. The non-personally identifiable information that Mediaplex collects may include, as an example, IP address, browser types, operating systems, domain names, access dates and times, referring website addresses, online transactions and browsing and search activity "Non-PII").

The Non-PII collected is used for the enhancement of our services to our Clients, marketing, and to more effectively match advertisements and website content to Internet users.

B. Email Marketing

Mediaplex offers Clients an email marketing product, MOJO Mail. MOJO Mail is used to configure and send email communications and promotional offers to permission-based email lists provided by its Clients. In this process, certain PII is stored and managed in MOJO Mail. This PII is provided by Client to Mediaplex. Mediaplex does collect general email campaign performance data in order to report aggregated results to Clients.

C. Cookies, Web Beacons, and Log Files

Mediaplex may serve online advertising as part of its Mediaplex Services. In doing so, Mediaplex may use Log files, Web beacons or Cookies on your computer and will use Non-PII collected as part of the Mediaplex Services to serve online advertisements for the Client.

"Log files" track actions occurring on websites and collect data, which may include your IP address, browser type, Internet service provider, referring/exit pages, platform type, date/time stamp, click data and types of advertisements viewed.

"Web beacons" are electronic files used to track your data, which may include the navigation of a website or collection of sites, the completion of transactions, submittal of applications and browsing behavior.

"Cookies" are files (e.g. HTTP cookies) that are stored on your Internet enabled device (which includes your computer, BlackBerry or other PDA). Cookies are used to improve the experience web users have when they see online advertisements. We may use Cookies to estimate the total reach of an advertising campaign, as well as frequency of display. This allows Clients to determine with greater accuracy the composition of the audience they reach. Cookies are also used to control the delivery of a series of advertisements to a web browser, and to limit the number of times a web browser receives any one advertisement.

There are two classes of Cookies based on how long they remain on your system: (i) "Session Cookies", if used, are used only during your visit to the Sites and are erased once you close your browser, and (ii) "Persistent Cookies" remain on your browser for up to 3 years from your last visit to the Sites and enable us to remember you on subsequent visits to the Sites and provide more relevant content to you on such Sites.

There are many misconceptions about cookies, some of which we will try to address in this policy. Cookies cannot erase your hard drive or otherwise damage your computer and do not tell us an e-mail address or any other PII. Mediaplex does not and cannot use cookies, log files or web beacons to retrieve PII from your computer.

A useful resource on understanding cookies may be found at www.allaboutcookies.org.</SUBTEXT>

We have certified that we adhere to the Safe Harbor Privacy Principles of notice, choice, onward transfer, security, data integrity, access, and enforcement.  To learn more about the Safe Harbor program, and to view the company's certification, please visit www.export.gov/safeharbor.
