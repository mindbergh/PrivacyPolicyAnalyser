        <SUBTITLE>Personally Identifiable Information</SUBTITLE>
        <SUBTEXT>NYU will not collect personally identifiable information about you when you visit our websites or digital properties unless you voluntarily provide us with that information.  NYU may request personally identifiable information from you if you wish, for example, to access a password-protected website, join a mailing list, or engage in a payment transaction.  NYU may use that information for such purposes as fulfilling your requests for our information or services, communication information that may be of interest to you, and conducting research surveys.

        <SUBTITLE>Non-Personally Identifiable Information</SUBTITLE>
        <SUBTEXT>When you visit NYU websites and other NYU digital properties, we may automatically collect and store information sent by your web browser, such as IP addresses (i.e., the Internet address of your computer) in server logs. We also collect standard information about your computer (such as your web browser and operating system) and about your usage of our websites and digital properties (such as pages visited, length of visit, and search queries).  This information, which does not identify your personally, is aggregated and used to help diagnose problems and suggest points for improving parts of our website and digital properties. For example, we utilize statistical software to identify which parts of our website are most heavily used and which portion of our audience comes from within the NYU network.</SUBTEXT>

        <SUBTITLE>Behavioral Advertising</SUBTITLE>
        <SUBTEXT>NYU may contract with third party vendors to show our advertisements on non-NYU websites and digital properties. NYU and third party vendors with whom we contract may use cookies and web beacons to serve our ads based on your prior visit(s) to NYU websites and digital properties and to assess the effectiveness of our ads. This is also called Targeted Advertising or Interest-Based Advertising.
These techniques use only non-personally identifiable information, and you may opt out of behavioral advertising by visiting the Network Advertising Initiative opt out page at http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp.</SUBTEXT>
