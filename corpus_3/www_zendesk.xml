        <SUBTITLE>What do we mean by Personal Information</SUBTITLE>
        <SUBTEXT>In this Policy, “personal information” means information or an information set that identifies or could be used by or on behalf of Zendesk to identify an individual.  Except as described in this Policy, Zendesk will not give, sell, rent or loan any personal information to any third party.

Personal information does not include “Usage Data” which we define as encoded or anonymized information or aggregated data we collect about a group or category of services, features or users which does not contain personally identifying information.  Usage Data helps us understand trends in usage of the Service so that we can better consider new features or otherwise tailor the Service. In addition to collecting and using Usage Data ourselves, we may share Usage Data with third parties, including our customers, partners and service providers, for various purposes, including to help us better understand our customers' needs and improve the Service as well as for advertising and marketing purposes.  We do not share Usage Data with third parties in a way that would enable them to identify you personally.</SUBTEXT>

        <SUBTEXT />
    </SECTION>
    <SECTION>
        <SUBTITLE>Information You Provide to Us</SUBTITLE>
        <SUBTEXT>When you register for the Service, we ask for personal information such as your name, address,  phone number, e-mail address and credit card information, as well as certain related information like your company name and website name.  If you sign-up for a 30-day free trial account, you are not required to enter your credit card information unless and until you decide to continue with a paid subscription to the Service.  Zendesk uses a third-party intermediary to manage credit card processing.  This intermediary is not permitted to store, retain, or use your billing information for any purpose except for credit card processing on Zendesk's behalf.

Zendesk may use the personal information you provide to operate the Service and tailor it to your needs, for billing, identification and authentication, to contact and communicate with you about the Service and your use of the Service, send you marketing materials (subject to your opt-out option), for research purposes, and to generally improve the content and functionality of the Service.

Zendesk may also share your personal information with its third-party service providers (such as its credit card processors and hosting partners) to provide the necessary hardware, software, networking, storage, and other services we use to operate the Service and maintain a high quality user experience. We do not permit our service providers to use the personal information you provide for their marketing purposes.</SUBTEXT>
    </SECTION>
    <SECTION>
        <SUBTITLE>Log Files</SUBTITLE>
        <SUBTEXT>As is true with most websites, Zendesk gathers certain information automatically and stores it in log files. This information includes internet protocol addresses as well as browser, internet service provider, referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and click stream data. Occasionally, we may connect personal information to information gathered in our log files, as necessary to improve the Service for individual customers. Otherwise, we generally use this information as we would any Usage Data, to analyze trends, administer and maintain the Service, or track usage of various features within the Service.</SUBTEXT>
    </SECTION>
    <SECTION>
        <SUBTITLE>Cookies</SUBTITLE>
        <SUBTEXT>A “cookie” is a small software file stored temporarily or placed on your computer's hard drive.  The main purpose of a cookie is to allow a web server to identify your computer and web browser, and tailor web pages and/or login information to your preferences.  Cookies help us promptly display the information you need to use the capabilities of the Service and other information which we consider to be of interest to you.  By gathering and remembering information about your website preferences through cookies, we can provide a better web and marketing experience.  Cookies don't give us access to users' computers, and the information we collect through cookies doesn't include personal information.

When you use the Service we utilize “session cookies,” which allow us to uniquely identify your browser while you are logged in and to process your online transactions.  Session cookies disappear from your computer when you close your web browser or turn off your computer. We also utilize “persistent cookies” to identify you as a Zendesk customer, agent or end user and make it easier for you to log into and use the Service.  Persistent cookies remain on your computer after you close your web browser or turn off your computer.

We utilize various categories of cookies, which are summarized below along with the options available to you to manage them.

Essential: Essential cookies are those that are critical to the functionality of the Service.  We use these cookies to keep a user logged into the Service and remember relevant information when the user returns to the Service.

Functional: We use functional cookies to track users' activities in the Service, understand their preferences and improve their user experience. These cookies can also be used to remember configurations of the Service that you can customize.

Marketing: We engage third party providers to serve a variety of marketing cookies that enable us track and analyze usage, navigational and other statistical information from visitors to the Zendesk Websites.  This information does not include personal information though we may reassociate this information with personal information we have collected when it is received.  Marketing cookies are also used to track the performance of our advertisements and are employed by third party advertising networks that we utilize.  These ad networks follow online activities of visitors to the Zendesk Websites and use this information to inform, optimize and serve tailored advertisements on the Zendesk Websites or on other websites you visit that we believe would most effectively promote the Service to you.  We also use third parties to collect information that assists us in other methods of “remarketing” our Service to visitors to the Zendesk Websites, including customized email communications.

    <SECTION>
        <SUBTITLE>Web Beacons</SUBTITLE>
        <SUBTEXT>We also employ web beacons to help us better manage content in the Service by informing us what content is effective.  Web beacons are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of internet users.  Unlike cookies, which are stored on a user's computer hard drive, web beacons are embedded invisibly on websites.  We tie the information gathered by web beacons to personal information we otherwise collect, and use them in our HTML-based emails to learn which emails have been opened by recipients.  This allows us to gauge the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns as well as to operate and improve the Service.  You can opt-out of these emails by following the unsubscribe instructions within such marketing emails.</SUBTEXT>

        <SUBTITLE>Protection of Information</SUBTITLE>
        <SUBTEXT>Zendesk is committed to ensuring the security of your personal information. We utilize robust precautions to protect the confidentiality and security of the personal information within the Service, by employing technological, physical and administrative security safeguards, such as firewalls and carefully-developed security procedures. For example, when you enter sensitive information (such as login credentials and all your activity on our Service platform) we encrypt the transmission of that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL). These technologies, procedures and other measures are used in an effort to ensure that your data is safe, secure, and only available to you and to those you authorized to access your data. However, no internet, e-mail or other electronic transmission is ever fully secure or error free, so you should take care in deciding what information you send to us in this way.</SUBTEXT>

        <SUBTITLE>Safe Harbor Data Privacy Notice</SUBTITLE>
        <SUBTEXT>Zendesk complies with the US – EU and US – Swiss Safe Harbor Frameworks for protecting the privacy of data flowing from the EU and Switzerland to the United States, as set forth by the US Department of Commerce.

We frequently enter agreements with our EU customers to provide them access to our Service, which includes the processing of information relating their customers. In providing our Service, we do not own, control or direct the use of the information stored or processed on our platform at the direction of our customers, and in fact we are largely unaware of what information is being stored on our platform and only access such information as authorized by our customers or as required by law. Only you or your customers are entitled to access, retrieve and direct the use of such information. As such, we are only the “data processors” and not the “data controllers” of the information on our platform for purposes of the EU Directive on Data Protection (Directive 95/46/EC) and the Swiss Federal Act on Data Protection. Our EU or Swiss customers, who control their customer data and send it to Zendesk for processing, are the “controllers” of that data and are responsible for compliance with the Directive.  In particular, Zendesk's customers are responsible for complying with the Directive and relevant data protection legislation in the relevant EU member state before sending personal information to Zendesk for processing. We work with our customers to help them provide notice to their customers concerning the purpose for which personal information is collected.

As the processors of personal information on behalf of our customers, we follow their instructions with respect to the information they control. In doing so, we implement appropriate technical, physical and administrative measures against unauthorized processing of such information and against loss, destruction of, or damage to, personal information.</SUBTEXT>

        <SUBTITLE>Choice</SUBTITLE>
        <SUBTEXT>We process and store information on behalf of our customers.

If you are a Zendesk customer and would like to opt-out of getting communications from Zendesk please contact us at privacy@zendesk.com or follow the unsubscribe instructions included in each marketing email. Requests to opt-out of transfers to our third-party vendors will also be considered, but limitations on data sharing may make it difficult or impossible to provide the Service in this manner.</SUBTEXT>

We will respond to such queries within 30 business days.

Zendesk has no direct relationship with the individuals with whom our customers may interact using the Service.   Any such individual seeking access to, or who would like to correct, amend, or delete data which may be stored in the Service should direct his query to the applicable Zendesk customer acting as the “data controller” for such information.  At the request of our customers, we remove any data placed in their accounts within 30 business days.</SUBTEXT>
