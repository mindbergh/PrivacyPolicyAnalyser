        <SUBTITLE>Traffic Data</SUBTITLE>
        <SUBTEXT>Each time a visitor comes to a WND site, our servers collect some basic technical information, including the visitor's ISP (e.g. AOL, Comcast, or AT&amp;T), referring site (e.g. Google, Facebook, or Yahoo) and browser and platform type (e.g., a Safari browser on a Macintosh platform).

We also track visitors' activity on our sites (i.e. how traffic flows within the WND sites) We may merge information about visitors and visits into group data, which may be shared on an
aggregate basis with our advertisers.

However, we will not disclose your individual identity or personal data to any party.

When we do present information to outside companies it will be in an aggregate fashion, that will prevent the company from identifying you or contacting you.

We will retain your information for as long as your account is active or as long as needed to provide you services. If you wish to cancel your account or request that we no longer use your information contact us at privacy@wnd.com. We will retain and use your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.</SUBTEXT>

        <SUBTITLE>WND and cookies</SUBTITLE>
        <SUBTEXT>A cookie is a small amount of data that is sent to your browser from a server and stored on your computer's hard drive. We use cookies in a very limited manner, primarily to help deliver advertisements so that you won't receive the same advertisement too many times. We use cookies to identify unique browsers that visit us and to track site navigation. We also use cookies on our shopping site to make the ordering process more convenient for visitors. Cookies are used with our online polls to insure accurate results by allowing only one vote per computer on the current questions.

Other sites that place advertisements on our site, or which we may provide a link referencing an article that is available to view on WND, also have the ability to assign their cookies to you. WND does not have access or control over these third party cookies.

Cookies cannot be used to identify individuals, only machines. So these advertisers will not know who a visitor is, nor will they have any personally identifiable information about a visitor.</SUBTEXT>

        <SUBTITLE>Clear Gifs (Web Beacons)</SUBTITLE>
        <SUBTEXT>WND employs a software technology called clear gifs (a.k.a. Web Beacons), that help us better manage content on our site by informing us what content is effective. Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of Web users. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user's computer hard drive, clear gifs are embedded invisibly on Web pages and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence. We do not tie information gathered by clear gifs to our customers' personally identifiable information.

We use clear gifs in our HTML-based emails to let us know which emails have been opened by recipients. This allows us to gauge the effectiveness of certain communications and the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns. If you would like to opt-out of these emails, please see “Choice and Opt-out.”</SUBTEXT>

        <SUBTITLE>Flash LSOs</SUBTITLE>
        <SUBTEXT>Third Parties, with whom we partner to display advertising based upon your Web browsing activity, use Flash cookies to collect and store information.

Flash cookies are different from browser cookies because of the amount of, type of, and manner in which data is stored. Cookie management tools provided by your browser will not remove Flash cookies. To learn how to manage privacy and storage settings for Flash cookies click here.

We partner with a third party ad network to display advertising on our Web site. Our ad network partner uses cookies and Web beacons to collect non-personally identifiable information about your activities on this and other Web sites to provide you targeted advertising based upon your interests. If you wish not to have this information used for the purpose of serving you targeted ads, you may opt-out by clicking here. Please note this does not opt you out of being served advertising.
