        <SUBTITLE>SECTION II: MASTER DATA</SUBTITLE>
        <SUBTEXT>What is master data?
Master data, in this statement, means all data related directly to a User as a person, irrespective of your actual usage of the Service. This includes i.e. a User's name, e-mail address and other contact information, birthday, gender, research vita, information about what conferences the User attends and what ResearchGate Groups the User is a member of.

What master data is collected and stored by ResearchGate?
ResearchGate stores data you enter and submit on the Web service; i.e., if you submit your academic career to your profile page, ResearchGate will store it. Or, if you join a group or a conference, ResearchGate will store that information.

What master data is processed by ResearchGate and why?
ResearchGate will process your data in order to run the Web service, for example, if any internet user visits your profile page, we process your data in order to show your profile page. Very basic data (e.g. your name) is visible to all users. However, you can choose to make most of your data only visible to your closer friends. ResearchGate will also process your master data randomly to provide dynamic Web pages to you that are individually adapted considering your master data. Furthermore, ResearchGate reserves the right to process your master data to generate anonymous statistics. Such anonymous statistics will contain no information about any individual user.

Does ResearchGate process my e-mail adress and send e-mails?
ResearchGate will process your email address solely to send e-mails to you containing information or notifications about the Service. ResearchGate reserves the right to attach a minor part to such e-mails containing advertisements for products and services of any third party.

How can I see what master data is stored and how can I change or delete it?
You can see and edit your data on your profile pages. You can also delete all your master data but your name, your e-mail address and your password. If you cancel your ResearchGate subscription (if you wish to do so, please contact ResearchGate by e-mail, mail or fax), we will delete all your data. Unlike some other Web services, ResearchGate will definitely not store any personal data of former users.</SUBTEXT>

        <SUBTITLE>SECTION III: TRAFFIC DATA</SUBTITLE>
        <SUBTEXT>What is traffic data?
Traffic data is data about your ResearchGate usage. This is mainly tracking information on log-in times, duration, and activities while logged in Traffic data also includes your IP address/es and information sent automatically by your Web browser such as your browser software, preferred languages, and the name of your operating system.

What traffic does ResearchGate collect and store?
ResearchGate collects your traffic data, as defined before, and will store that data for the duration of your session (a session starts when you log in and ends when you log out. The session automatically times out after approx. 60 minutes of inactivity). After your session ends, ResearchGate reserves the right to store traffic data for one day. During that period, your data is only connected to your IP address and not to your user account, which has your personal information. ResearchGate will not be able to attach any individual user's name to traffic data. However, it is possible that someone else (i.e., your internet service provider) could do so. After this one day, ResearchGate will only store information about how many profile pages you viewed within thirty days. Only the number of pages are saved. Information about which pages you have viewed and when are not stored.

What traffic data is processed by ResearchGate and why?
During your session, ResearchGate needs to process traffic data to provide the Web service. After the session, ResearchGate reserves the right to process traffic data (within one day, as mentioned above) to generate anonymous statistics. ResearchGate uses this information to improve its services and user experience. ResearchGate may also process traffic data for security and fraud-detection reasons. The number of profile pages you viewed is a security measure for the protection of personal data. Processing this information helps ResearchGate detect and prevent "data harvesting", meaning automatic retrieval of profile pages to gain many users' personal data.

How can I view stored traffic data, change or delete it?
Please contact the ResearchGate support team for any requests related to viewing, changing or deleting your traffic data. When you cancel your ResearchGate subscription, we automatically delete your personal traffic data.</SUBTEXT>

Do I have to use cookies?
No. Cookies can make some functions more convenient for you, as they help to generate individualized pages, but ResearchGate can be used without cookies.

If you choose to, there will be a cookie for your login information, so that you are automatically logged in when you visit ResearchGate. You must not use this option if the computer you use is not under your exclusive control, because other people using your computer will be able to log in to ResearchGate without a password.

To generate such pages or functions dynamically, the information stored in the cookie will be processed randomly. ResearchGate will never store cookie data.
