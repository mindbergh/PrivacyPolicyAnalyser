        <SUBTITLE>Use of your information</SUBTITLE>
        <SUBTEXT>Trade Me does not sell or rent your personal information to third parties.

Trade Me collects personal information about you through your use of the Services and the Website, including your registration details and information relating to your use of the Website and the content you access (like listings you have viewed and the search queries you input).


Trade Me may use this personal information to help us provide the Services to you, to verify your identity, to enforce or apply our terms and conditions, to protect the rights, property, or safety of Trade Me Limited, our users, or others, for internal research purposes, for promoting and marketing other Trade Me products and Services to you, and for any other use that you authorise. Your membership's trading history may be published in your feedback.

We release account and other personal information only when we believe release is appropriate for legal compliance and law enforcement (including to government agencies with statutory law enforcement responsibilities); to facilitate court proceedings; enforce or apply our terms and conditions; or protect the rights, property, or safety of Trade Me Limited, our users, or others. Government agencies with statutory roles enabling them to request data from us includes but is not restricted to Police, IRD and the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment. Members can contact Trade Me to ask whether such information has been provided.

Where Trade Me contracts third parties to undertake various services, we may provide those third parties with personal information required to fulfil those services. These contracted services may include sending you letters for address verification, or conducting research for Trade Me to ensure the Services we provide you are relevant and personalised to your interests. Trade Me may also use third party customer relationship management services to manage customer agreements, enquiries, and generate reports for internal use. We will require any third party to undertake strict precautions to protect any personal information against unauthorised use or disclosure.

Further, it is our policy to immediately remove any member from any mailing list upon the member's request. In addition, Trade Me will send newsletters and other communications to members. Newsletters will contain clear and obvious instructions for how the member can remove himself or herself from that mailing list.

We do use email as a means of receiving feedback from our members, and we encourage you to email us with your questions or comments.</SUBTEXT>

        <SUBTEXT>You are responsible for all actions taken with your user name, email address and password, including fees. Therefore we do not recommend that you disclose your Trade Me password to any third parties. If you choose to share your user name, email address and password or your information with third parties to provide you additional services, you are responsible for all actions taken with this information and therefore you should review that third party's privacy policy.

    <SECTION>
        <SUBTITLE>Credit and debit card security</SUBTITLE>
        <SUBTEXT>We work diligently to protect the security of your personal information, including credit and debit card information.

We protect your credit and debit card information during transmission by using the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) protocol, which encrypts your information when transmitted over the Internet. Trade Me retains only partial card details. However they may be held by either Direct Payment Solutions (DPS) - review their Privacy Policy - or Paystation - review their Privacy Policy - depending on which provider processes the transaction.

When topping up your Trade Me account by credit/debit card, you may have the option to "save this card for next time". If you choose this option, your credit/debit card details are encrypted and securely stored by DPS or Paystation.</SUBTEXT>

    <SECTION>
        <SUBTITLE>API</SUBTITLE>
        <SUBTEXT>Trade Me provides an application programming interface (API) to enable software to interface with the Website. The API enables developers to build new applications for our members to use. We use it ourselves to power our mobile applications. As a result, information you publish on Trade Me may be accessed through the API and may appear in other places such as applications or websites. We may charge third parties in various ways for access to our API.

Some applications enable you to interact with Trade Me through the API in a way that requires you to login. To do this, most of these applications will direct you through a secure process on Trade Me called 'OAuth', where you are able to let the application connect to your account. A smaller set of applications will require you to enter your username and password directly into the application, and only applications specifically authorised by Trade Me are capable of doing this. In no case will anyone be able to retrieve your password from the API.

If you allow an application to connect to your Trade Me account, that application will be able to access information that you can see when you are logged in to Trade Me. This includes the information found within My Trade Me, such as your watch list, sold items or personal contact information. You should only allow applications you trust to access your Trade Me account.

If someone is using an application to access Trade Me and trades with you, that application may be able to access information that you provide to the other person during the trading process, such as your email and delivery address.

Anyone using our API must comply with Trade Me's API terms and conditions and this Privacy Policy.</SUBTEXT>

        <SUBTITLE>Trade Me Jobs</SUBTITLE>
        <SUBTEXT>Trade Me facilitates sending job applications to organisations advertising on Trade Me Jobs. We forward applications, including disclosure of your personal information, on your behalf directly to the organisation whose job you apply for. We only disclose information that you provide to us in your application.

Applications you send are stored on our servers for a limited time. We do not read applications.

The CVs and documents section of My Trade Me allows you to store and re-use CVs, cover letters, or other documents. We securely store documents that you save in the CVs and documents sections, and they are available to you, organisations you send them to, and our Website operators. We may use software to scan your CVs stored in My Trade Me for the purpose of personalising and improving the relevance of job advertisements presented to you. You can delete your CVs and documents at any time through My Trade Me. If your CV is deleted, previously scanned information may be stored in our database for a period of time after the CV has been deleted.

Documents you upload to the CVs and documents section of My Trade Me will expire and be deleted after 5 years.

Documents that are deleted may persist for a limited time in our backup systems.</SUBTEXT>

        <SUBTITLE>Cookies and local storage</SUBTITLE>
        <SUBTEXT>Trade Me uses various technologies, including cookies and local storage, to collect and store information about you when you visit Trade Me.

Cookies and local storage allow us to store information (including your personal information) in a file on the device you use to access Trade Me.

Trade Me uses "session" cookies to temporarily store information to help you use Trade Me. This information is used to deliver the right content to you as you use Trade Me and avoids unnecessarily asking you to log in. Session cookies expire immediately when you close your browser or are deleted after 30 minutes of no activity on Trade Me.

Trade Me also uses "persistent" cookies and local storage to personalise the user experience, to help protect our members and to provide us with research information (such as how often members visit Trade Me each month). Persistent cookies allow us to track users on Trade Me and helps us identify users abusing the Trade Me service. A persistent auto-login cookie is also stored when you select the "remember me" option when logging in. The auto-login cookie is removed if you log out.

Trade Me also participates in Google's AdWords pay-per-click advertising programme. AdWords advertisements appear on Google's search result pages and on the Google Display Network. Trade Me ads may also appear on other websites in the Google Display Network. Google uses cookies to target ads to you, including to measure the number of Google users that click on certain advertisements and visit certain Trade Me pages, or who complete certain actions on Trade Me (like adding an item to a Watchlist).

        <SUBTITLE>Advertising and third party links</SUBTITLE>
        <SUBTEXT>Some Trade Me advertisers may request information directly from users, or link to sites that do so. Trade Me has no control over its advertisers' privacy policies, and encourages users to review such policies prior to submitting any personal information to them.

Trade Me contains non-advertising links to a variety of third party sites to enhance the member experience. Trade Me has no control of either the content or privacy policies of such sites, nor should such links be considered an endorsement of these sites except where otherwise noted.

In some cases, third party advertisers may also use cookies in certain advertisements that appear on the website for advertising purposes, or collect information in the course of advertising being served. For example, Trade Me participates in Google AdSense advertising, and as part of this, Google may use cookies in order to reduce the number of times you see the same ad.

Trade Me also uses the services of SAS to deliver display advertisements intended to be relevant to your interests, based on the information you have provided to us through the use of any of our Services.

Trade Me uses Google remarketing to serve relevant ads to you after you leave our website. When you visit pages on our website, Google may place a cookie on your browser. Then when you later visit another website in the Google Display Network, you may see relevant ads from Trade Me. You can opt out of Google's use of these cookies by visiting Google's Ads Preferences Manager. View Google's advertising privacy policies.

Trade Me also makes advertising space available through the DoubleClick AdExchange to other advertisers. If those advertisers use remarketing, you may see ads related to other websites you have previously visited.</SUBTEXT>

        <SUBTITLE>Photos</SUBTITLE>
        <SUBTEXT>Photos often contain EXIF data. EXIF data may include location information, such as when and where each photo was taken, and details of the device used to take it. If you upload photos that include EXIF data to Trade Me, we will store this information and use it to better understand the use of photos on our site and to help us provide a safe marketplace.

        <SUBTITLE>Other information we collect</SUBTITLE>
        <SUBTEXT>We use additional information to do internal research on our users' demographics, interests, and behaviour to better understand and serve you and our community. This information may include the URL that you just came from (whether this URL is on our site or not), which URL you next go to (whether this URL is on our site or not), what browser you are using, and your IP address. We may also use information from third parties, such as geo-demographic information.

Trade Me uses information we hold about you to provide you with a more personalised experience, such as suggesting things you might like, and suggesting search terms to you based on your recent searches. You can disable previous search terms from appearing by clicking on the "settings" icon in the search box.

Users who login have their IP addresses recorded. This information will only be provided to legal authorities in cases of suspected fraud or for law enforcement purposes. This information is stored securely and will not be provided to other members or non-authorised parties.

If you choose to post messages in our message areas or leave feedback for other users, we will collect that information you provide to us.

If you send us personal correspondence, such as emails or letters, or if other users or third parties send us correspondence about your activities or postings on the Site, we may collect such information into a file specific to you.

        <SUBTITLE>Internet statistics and analytics</SUBTITLE>
        <SUBTEXT>Trade Me, like most large New Zealand websites, uses the Nielsen Online counting system to collect information such as the number of visitors per day or the number of pages requested per day. To do this, Trade Me has a small piece of code on each page which counts these statistics. This enables us to see where we are in the "top 10" list of New Zealand websites.

For more information, view the Nielsen Online privacy policy.

Trade Me uses Google Analytics to better understand the behaviour of visitors to our website, and to improve our website. For example, it helps us to identify how many users visit a particular page, and how many take a further step, such as bidding. We have opted out of Google Analytics' data sharing settings. For more information, view Google Analytics' information on safeguarding your data.</SUBTEXT>

        <SUBTITLE>Mobile applications</SUBTITLE>

"Push Notification" preferences can be configured in the application's settings.

Trade Me uses Flurry to support our mobile applications. Flurry collects data for performance analysis, usage behaviour, technical information about the device, firmware and carrier. This information is confidential and available only to Trade Me in an aggregate form and individual user data is not identifiable.
