        <SUBTITLE>COLLECTION OF INFORMATION</SUBTITLE>
        <SUBTEXT>Personal Information
MNN.com may ask you to register and provide personal information in certain instances, such as when you choose to personalize your use of our Website for environmental interest, when you ask a question of our experts, or when you contact our customer support group. Personally identifiable information that we may collect includes your name, e-mail address, and address.  MNN.com may also collect demographic information such as your age, gender, zip code, and interests.

If you choose not to register, you can still use most of our Website. But you won't have full access to our user-generated video and blogging channels.

Children's Personal Information
MNN.com does not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from users under the age of 13. If we find out that we have such personal information, we will take reasonable steps to delete it.

Website Usage Information
MNN.com tracks navigational data (log files, server logs, click-stream) and information about how our Website is used by you (through cookies, Internet tags, or web beacons). We also collect information such as the URL of the Website you previously visited and the time of day that you use our Website. MNN.com also keeps track of the pages you visit within our Website as well as any transaction details (downloads, orders, requests, or referrals). You can set your browser to notify you when a cookie is sent, or to refuse or delete cookies altogether, but in such cases certain features of our Website might not function as expected.

Third-Party Ad-serving Companies
On our Website, we will display third-party advertisements. While many of these advertisements are displayed by MNN.com, we may allow third-party ad-serving companies or ad networks to display advertisements on our Website. Some of these ad networks may place a persistent cookie in order to recognize your computer each time they send you an online advertisement. Thus, third party ad-serving companies or ad networks may compile information about where you are using your computer, where you saw their advertisements, and which ads are clicked on. This information allows the third party to deliver targeted advertisements that they believe will be of most interest to you. MNN.com does not have access to the cookies that may be placed by the third-party ad-serving companies or ad networks. We will not share information that will specifically identify you to an ad-serving company or ad</SUBTEXT>

MNN.com collects, integrates, and uses your personal information to help enhance and personalize your use of our Website and the services that we may offer.

This information is also used to provide general statistics regarding use of our Website. We may also use such information for research or improvements of our Website and the services we offer you. This data is also used by MNN.com to deliver customized content and advertising to you when your online behavior indicates that you are interested in a particular subject area.
