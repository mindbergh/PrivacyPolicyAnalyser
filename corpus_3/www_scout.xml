        <SUBTEXT>North American Membership Group, Inc. ("Scout" or "we" or "us") operates the website http://www.scout.com ("scout.com" or "Site"), which is an integrated network of websites that provides public forums and publishes exclusive content focusing on high school, college and professional team sports. The services Scout offers include any Scout-branded URL, Premium Subscriptions, which allows users to view premium online content and participate in premium forums, magazine subscriptions, public forums and any other features, content, or applications offered from time to time by Scout in connection with Scout's business, including when accessed via the Internet, mobile or other device (collectively, the "Scout Services").

As set forth in our Terms of Use, Scout.com is a general audience website, is not targeted to children, and does not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13 years of age.

This Privacy Policy describes Scout's collection, use and sharing of personal information about users (e.g., information that identifies a specific person, such as full name or email address) through Scout Services where that personal information is not otherwise publicly available on the Site. This Privacy Policy also describes generally Scout's practices for handling non-personally identifiable information (e.g., user interests, demographics, or Site usage) to the extent such non-personally identifiable information is associated with a particular user or user account. This Privacy Policy applies to all "users," including visitors (users who use some of the Scout Services without being registered with Scout), "Members" (users who have registered with Scout) and "Subscribers" (Members who have purchased a Premium Subscription or magazine subscription).</SUBTEXT>

When you register you will be required to register with a specific college, NFL, MLB team or high school page ("Preferred Team Website"). The Preferred Team Website may be operated or owned by a third party service provider selected by Scout

If you elect to purchase a Premium Subscription through the Site you will be required to provide personal financial information, including your credit card information, billing address or other payment information (collectively, "Personal Financial Information"), full name, phone number and shipping address in order to purchase such Scout Services. You must be 18 years of age or older to submit Personal Financial Information on the Site, including to place an order on the Site.

Public Forum Login Information. If you elect to post comments on any of the public forums provided on the Site you will be required to select a username and provide your email address. Your username will be public, which means it is available to everyone and will be displayed in search results on Scout.com and on external search engines. Please select your username carefully.

Site Collected Information

Site Activity Information. When users visit the Site, we may collect certain non-personally identifiable information about those visits. For example, in order to permit your connection to the Site, our servers receive and record information about your computer and browser, including potentially your IP address, browser type, and other software or hardware information. If you access the Scout Services from a mobile or other device, we may collect a device identifier assigned to that device or other transactional information for that device in order to serve content to it. We also may use cookies and other tracking technologies (including browser cookies, pixels, beacons, and Adobe flash technology including cookies), which are small bits of data that often include an identifier. Websites send this data to your browser when you first request a web page and then store the data on your computer so the website can access information when you make subsequent requests for pages from that website. We may use these technologies to gather information about your usage of the Site, such as pages you have visited, search queries you have run and advertisements you have seen.

Third parties that support Scout.com by serving advertisements or providing Scout Services, such as allowing users to share content, view premium content, or post to the forums or tracking aggregate Site usage statistics, may also use these technologies to collect similar information. Scout does not control these third-party technologies and their use is governed by the privacy policies of third parties using such technologies.

Scout may also work with third-party companies to display ads on Scout and elsewhere on the Internet. These companies may use cookies (a small text file), pixels, or similar technologies that are placed in browsers to gather information about your visits to Scout as well as your visits elsewhere on the Internet. These companies use this information to provide you more relevant advertising known as interest-based advertising. Some of these companies may be participants in the Digital Advertising Alliance (“DAA”). The DAA offers a choice mechanism with respect to certain types of data collection and use. Visit www.aboutads.info to exercise choice with respect to participants of the DAA. If you change computers or browsers, use multiple computers or browsers, or delete your cookies, you may need to repeat this process for each computer and each browser.

Most browsers are initially set to accept cookies, but you can change your settings to notify you when a cookie is being set or updated, or to block cookies altogether. Please consult the "Help" section of your browser for more information (e.g., http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Block-or-allow-cookies). Users can manage the use of Flash technologies with the Flash management tools available at Adobe's website, see http://www.adobe.com/products/flashplayer/security/privacy_policy/faq.html. Please note that by blocking any or all cookies you may not have access to certain features or personalization available through Scout Services.

        <SUBTEXT>Means of Notice and Choice. This Privacy Policy is the primary means by which Scout provides you with notice and choice regarding its collection and use of your personal information. Scout will not use your personal information in a manner different from what is described in this Privacy Policy without your permission.

Privacy Policy Changes. Scout may modify this Privacy Policy as necessary. If we make material changes to this Privacy Policy that expand our rights to use your personal information, we will notify you to seek your consent either through an email or a prominent posting on the Site.

Location of Data Storage. The Scout Services are hosted in the United States. If you are a user located outside the United States, you understand and consent to having any personal information you provide transferred to, stored and processed in the United States. United States data protection and other relevant laws and regulations may not be the same as those in your jurisdiction. As a result, please read this Privacy Policy with care.

Linked Websites. The Scout Services may also be linked to other websites operated by Scout ("Affiliated Site") or third parties. Scout is not responsible for the privacy practices of any such third parties, and once you leave the Scout Services via a link, or click an advertisement, you should check the applicable privacy policy of the third-party site. Additionally, users who visit an Affiliated Site should still refer to the Affiliated Site's separate privacy policy, which may differ in some respects from this Privacy Policy. This Privacy Policy does not apply to those websites that do not display or link to this Privacy Policy or have its own privacy statements.

Collection of Personal Financial Information by a Third Party. You acknowledge and agree that this Privacy Policy will not apply to any Personal Financial Information that you provide to any independent third party company on the Site and that all payment obligations related to such purchase shall be governed solely by the applicable independent third party company's privacy policy. You further acknowledge and agree that Scout will have no liability for or control over such independent third party company's use or protection of your Personal Financial Information. You should check the privacy policy of the independent third party company's website to determine how it will handle any Personal Financial Information it collects from you and/or processes. You acknowledge and agree that in the event that such independent third party company experiences a data breach that compromises or otherwise affects your Personal Financial Information, Scout shall in no way be responsible or liable to you for such breach. You should contact the applicable independent third party company regarding any such data breach.</SUBTEXT>
