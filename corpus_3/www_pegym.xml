        <SUBTITLE>Our Privacy Policy in a Nutshell</SUBTITLE>
        <SUBTEXT>Your privacy is important to you, and therefore it's important to PEGym.com (“We”). At PE Gym.com our policy follows a few basic principles:

We don't ask you for personal information unless we truly need it. (We can't stand services that ask you for things like your gender or income level for no apparent reason.)
We don't share your personal information with anyone except to comply with the law, develop our products, or protect our rights.
We don't store personal information on our servers unless required for the on-going operation of one of our services.
At PEGym.com, we aim to make it as simple as possible for you to control what's visible to the public, seen by search engines, kept private, and permanently deleted.</SUBTEXT>

PEGym.com also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses.
