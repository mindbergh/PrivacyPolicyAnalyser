Sprint Corporation Privacy Policy

This Privacy Policy ("Policy") describes how Sprint Corporation ("Sprint") will collect, access, use or disclose your personal information. It applies to all of our products, services, and web sites ("Services"). A few of our Services are covered by different privacy policies and in the event of a conflict between the two, the product or service specific policy governs. For example, we may have a separate policy or agreement for certain products, services or brands. Our collection, access, use, disclosure and safeguarding of your personal information is subject to U.S. law.

Information you give us. The personal information we collect includes information you give us, such as name, postal address, telephone number, e-mail address, date of birth, social security number or other government identification number, demographics, activities, location information, and personal preferences. You may give us information in a variety of ways, including when you sign up for Services, communicate with customer care or register on www.sprint.com.

Information that we automatically collect. We automatically receive certain types of information whenever you use our Services. We may collect information about your device such as the type, version of operating system, signal strength, whether it is on and how it is functioning, as well as information about how you use the device and services available through it, such as your call and data usage and history, your location, web sites you have visited, applications purchased, applications downloaded or used, and other similar information.

        <SUBTITLE>INFORMATION WE SHARE</SUBTITLE>
        <SUBTEXT>We do not share your personal information with third parties other than as follows:

Service Providers. We may share personal information with third parties who perform services on our behalf.

Group Account Holders. We offer group accounts to business and government customers, family customers and other group account holders ("Group Accounts"). The account holder for Group Accounts is the entity or person that buys the service or product for its employees, family members or other authorized users. You (as the user of a device) may receive service, certain pricing, terms or other benefits through a Group Account with us. If so, we may share with that Group Account holder customer registration and other information related to your use of our services.

Third Party Verification Services. We may share limited personal information (e.g., address, phone number) with non-Sprint entities to assist with identity verification, and to prevent fraud and identity theft.

Other Third Parties with Your Consent. We may share information with other third parties with your consent. For example, you may agree to our sharing your information with other third parties to hear about their products and services. Use of the information you agree to share will be subject to those third parties' separate privacy policies.

Disclosures to Third Party Application and Service Providers. You may choose to use services and products offered by third parties through our Services or devices such as third party applications. When you leave our network you may also use mobile roaming services provided by third parties. Your use of such services and applications may result in these third parties collecting your personal information and obtaining information from Sprint, including location information (when applicable). You may also choose to give personal information directly to third parties when using our Services. In each case, personal information you give a third party will be subject to its terms, conditions, and policies—not this policy. You should review a third party's privacy policy and terms of service before providing your information or using the service.

Business Transfers. Personal information about you may be disclosed as part of any merger, acquisition, sale of company assets or transition of service to another provider. In the unlikely event of an insolvency, bankruptcy or receivership, personal information may also be transferred as a business asset.

Protection of Sprint and Others. We may access, monitor, use or disclose your personal information or communications to do things such as:

comply with the law or respond to lawful requests or legal process;
protect the rights or property of us, our agents, members, our customers, and others including to enforce our agreements, policies and terms of use;
respond to emergencies;
initiate, render, bill, and collect for services; or
facilitate or verify the appropriate calculation of taxes, fees, or other obligations due to a local, state, or federal government requirement; or determine eligibility for government benefits.

We may share information that is de-identified or in an aggregated form that does not directly identify you. We share de-identified or aggregate information for purposes such as to:

Conduct market or traffic flow analysis and reporting or produce or facilitate production by others of business and marketing reports to share with third parties. For example, we may aggregate customer information across a particular region and create a report showing that 10,000 subscribers from a given city visited a sports stadium. If you do not wish for us to use your information to produce de-identified and aggregated data sets in the reports we share with third parties, you may opt out at any time. See sprint.com/privacy for details.
With your opt-in consent only, customize or personalize advertising you see when using your wireless device to access the internet or mobile applications. We may use information about your mobile web browsing to deliver more relevant advertisements tailored to your interests, and we may share de-identified information with third parties so that they can tailor their advertising to your interests. To receive ads more relevant to your interests, you must opt in to this use and sharing of your information. See sprint.com/privacy for details on how to do so.

        <SUBTITLE>CHILDREN</SUBTITLE>
        <SUBTEXT>You must be 18 to subscribe to Sprint services. Nevertheless, as part of the Unlimited, My Way Student Promotion, a parent or legal guardian may provide a Sprint device to a child under the age of 13. In such cases, Sprint takes steps to minimize the data it collects from Sprint applications on the device and provides parents resources to control the information children can share with other parties. In some instances, a parent may be able to review or request deletion of the personal information collected from a child's device, or take steps to prevent further collection of such information. If you have any questions about Sprint's policies for student phones or about how to control the information collected on them from users under 13, or if you wish to correct or delete any personal information provided to Sprint on a student phone used by a child under 13, you can contact us using the contact information below. You may also control the content your child may access by logging into sprint.com/manage, and reviewing the My Preferences tab.
