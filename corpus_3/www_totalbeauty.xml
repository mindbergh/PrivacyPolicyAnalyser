We may share your information with our beauty brand partners (“Brand Partners”) in the course of your purchase of their Vouchers to help them process your redemption of their Vouchers. Any such redemption subjects the information provided to the participating Brand Partner to its privacy policy, and NOT this Privacy Policy. This may result in certain of our Brand Partners marketing to you directly. We do not have any responsibility for the actions of our Brand Partners nor do we have any liability to you for their actions.

Total Beauty may share your information with third party businesses for their online marketing purposes; but we do not disclose your personal information to any such third parties that may want to offer you their own products and services unless you have requested or authorized us to do so.

We may provide our postal mailing list (consisting of names and postal mailing addresses, but not email addresses) to trusted third party businesses whose products or services we believe may be of interest to you. To identify products that we believe may be of interest to you, we may aggregate information you have given us (demographic information, for example) and information that we have collected (such as past purchase history) available from our records and other sources.

We may share your personal information with our authorized service providers that perform certain services on our behalf. These services may include supporting our Site functionality, supporting contests, sweepstakes, surveys and other features offered through our Site, and filling orders and customer support.

We may disclose your personal information to strategic partners with which we undertake traffic linking arrangements or co-branded promotions. We may disclose your personal information in response to a subpoena or similar investigative demand, a court order, or a request for cooperation from a law enforcement or other government agency; to establish or exercise our legal rights; to defend against legal claims; or as otherwise required by law. In such cases, we may raise or waive any legal objection or right available to us.

We may disclose your personal information when we believe disclosure is appropriate in connection with efforts to investigate, prevent, or take other action regarding illegal activity, suspected fraud or other wrongdoing; to protect and defend the rights, property or safety of our company, our users, our employees, or others; to comply with applicable law or cooperate with law enforcement; or to enforce our Site's terms and conditions or other agreements or policies.

We may disclose your information to subsidiaries and affiliates of Total Beauty.

We may disclose your personal information in connection with a substantial corporate transaction, such as the sale of our business, a divestiture, merger, consolidation, or asset sale, or in the unlikely event of bankruptcy. The personal information which you provide to us is an asset of Total Beauty and may be included in the assets transferred in the event of a substantial corporate transaction.

There are a number of places on our Site where you may click on a hyperlink to access other web sites that do not operate under this Privacy Policy.
