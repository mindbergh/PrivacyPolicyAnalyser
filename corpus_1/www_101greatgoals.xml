        <SUBTITLE>101 Great Goals Privacy and Cookie Policy</SUBTITLE>
        <SUBTEXT>1. This Privacy and Cookie Policy explains how 101 Great Goals processes information about you both directly and indirectly. Please read this Privacy and Cookie Policy in conjunction with the terms &amp; conditions of the particular service or services you are using.
2. Please note that this Privacy Policy applies only to 101 Great Goals and any websites hosted by or on behalf of 101 Great Goals, but not to other companies' or organizations' websites to which we link and who operate their own privacy policy.
3. “Personal Data” is any data that identifies you. You agree that the Personal Data which you supply to us will be true, complete and accurate in all respects and you agree to notify us immediately of any changes to that. We will deal with your Personal Data in compliance with the current US data protection legislation.
4. 101 Great Goals or its Group companies or selected third parties will use your Personal Data which you provide to us together with other information we collect for providing the 101 Great Goals services to you, administration, marketing, research, analytics, Customer Services, tracking your device and web use preferences, and profiling your purchasing preferences. We may disclose your information to our service providers and agents to help us with these purposes, in accordance with US data protection legislation.
5. We may use your Personal Data to personalize your visits to our websites and recommend goods or services to you. We may also use the information to help us develop our offers and the layout of our websites to ensure that our services are as useful and enjoyable as possible. We may then (except to the extent that you have directed us not to) use this Personal Data for providing you with information about goods, services or promotions that may be of interest to you. Please call Customer Services on +1-781-431-6027 if you do not wish to receive such information from us as set out in this paragraph 5.
6. We may also use your Personal Data to contact you in order to conduct market research e.g. surveying needs and opinions on issues such as our performance. Any information that we collect from you in the course of such market research will be used to produce aggregate statistics about our sales, customers, traffic patterns and other site information, but these statistics will not include any information that could personally identify you.
7. The periods we keep your Personal Data can vary according to the purposes for which it is being used. Unless there is a specific legal requirement to keep your Personal Data we will not keep it for longer than necessary for the purposes for which the Personal Data was collected or for which it is to be further processed.
8. By using our services you consent to us processing your Personal Data in accordance with this Privacy and Cookie Policy and transferring your information to countries which do not provide the same level of data protection as the US if necessary for providing you services you require. If we do make such a transfer, we will put a contract in place to ensure your information is protected.
9. Unfortunately the transmission of data via the internet is not completely secure. Although we will do our best to protect your Personal Data we cannot guarantee the security of your data transmitted to our site, and transmission is at your own risk. Once we have received your information we will use strict procedures and security features to prevent unauthorised access.
10. By using our services you consent to us sharing your information with other companies who are our business partners. They or we may contact you by mail, telephone, electronic messaging services, fax or email to let you know about any goods, services or promotions which may be of interest to you. Please contact Customer Services on +1 781 431-6027, if you do not wish to receive such information from us as set out in this paragraph 10, or if you do not wish to receive information from our business partners, but remember that this will preclude you from receiving any of our special offers or promotions or those of our business partners.
11. If you have any questions about the handling or protection of your Personal Data or your rights under this Privacy and Cookie Policy please contact Customer Services by calling +1 781-431-6027 from any phone.
12. You have a right to ask for a copy of your information (for which we charge a small fee) and to correct any inaccuracies.
13. When you give us information about another person you confirm that they have appointed you to act for them, to consent to the processing of their personal data in accordance with this Privacy and Cookie Policy, and to the transfer of their information abroad and to receive on their behalf any data protection notices.
14. 101 Great Goals may disclose your Personal Data acting reasonably if it believes such action is necessary: to conform with a legal requirement or comply with the legal process, protect and defend the rights or property of 101 Great Goals, enforce this Privacy and Cookie Policy, or to protect the interests of its users.
15. Any changes we make to our Privacy and Cookie Policy in the future will be posted on this page and, where appropriate notified to you by SMS or e-mail.</SUBTEXT>

        <SUBTITLE>Cookies</SUBTITLE>
        <SUBTEXT>A cookie is a small, unique text file that is saved on your hard disk by a website. The cookie is used by the web site to identify your computer whenever you visit that website. Cookies cannot be used to run programs or deliver viruses to your computer. Cookies can only be read by a web server from the same domain (e.g. 101 Great Goals) that saved the cookie on your computer. 101 Great Goals and/or our third party advertisers may use cookies and Web beacons (also known as ‘pixel tags') to help you save time, track your usage patterns and provide you with a more personalised service on our web site. The main purpose of a cookie is to tell the Web server that you have returned to a specific Web page. For example, if you personalise Web pages, or register for products or services, a cookie helps our Web page server to recall your specific information. When you next visit the 101 Great Goals web site, the information you previously provided can be retrieved, so you can easily use the website features that you previously chose. Even if you use more than one computer on a regular basis, we can link cookies together so you will still receive a personalised online experience. 101 Great Goals can also personalize the information you see based on what we already know about you, so that you spend less time looking for things. So, instead of one site for all 101 Great Goals customers, each 101 Great Goals user can have a site which is unique to them. You have the ability to accept or decline cookies. 101 Great Goals uses cookies provided by third-party technology such as DoubleClick to collect data about the websites that you visit. We will use the data that we collect through our use of these cookies to ensure that you see relevant and useful adverts when you visit our websites. Most Web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies if you prefer. If you want to disable cookies, find out which browser you are using and follow the instructions below. Unfortunately, if you choose to decline cookies, some of the interactive features of the 101 Great Goals websites may not be available to you. We advise regular users of 101 Great Goals websites to accept cookies from 101 Great Goals. 101 Great Goals is committed to protecting your privacy and only uses cookies to improve our service to you, for example, by offering tailored information based on your interests. The usage patterns tracked by cookies remain confidential. 101 Great Goals does not share or sell any cookie-generated information. Please note that our advertisers or websites to which 101 Great Goals links may also use cookies, over which we have no control.
