        <SUBTEXT>UC Davis Web pages may collect personal information such as name, address, email address, telephone
number(s), and/or educational, research, or service interests. Such personal information may be requested
for research, public service or teaching programs, or for administrative purposes. Additional personal
information, such as credit card account information, may be requested for purchases, enrollment, or

UC Davis identifies your Internet Protocol (IP) address when you visit departmental and official Web sites. UC
Davis may also collect Web site usage statistics by IP address and maintain logs for identifying campus
account use.

Use of information: UC Davis uses Web-site-collected personal information for the purpose of future
communication back to you. Examples of this use include University-affiliated hosting organizations that need
to keep Web enrollees informed of campus programs, symposia, and/or special events.

UC Davis may use browser-IP-address information and anonymous-browser history for reporting aggregate
Web-site accesses and for profiling purposes. This information is generally used to improve Web presentation
and utilization. UC Davis also may use IP addresses for troubleshooting purposes. Some UC Davis Web
pages may use "cookies." Cookies are used for delivering Web content specific to users' interests and to
keep track of online purchasing transactions. Sensitive personal information is not stored within cookies.

Health information collected by any of the UC Davis entities covered by HIPAA (including Cowell Student
Health Center and UC Davis Health System) will be handled in accordance with the privacy and security
requirements therein.

Social security numbers may be collected only in accordance with UC Davis Policy and Procedure Manual
Section 320-22.</SUBTEXT>

        <SUBTITLE>Campus Commitment to Data Security</SUBTITLE>
        <SUBTEXT>Operators of Web servers and Web server software shall comply with UC Davis Policy and Procedure Manual
Section 310-22, and take reasonable steps to protect the security, integrity and privacy of information
submitted via UC Davis Web pages. UC Davis encourages producers of its Web pages, when seeking
personal information, to use the industry standard security protocol known as Secured Sockets Layer (SSL).
We strongly recommend the use of a Web browser capable of supporting SSL. The latest versions of
Microsoft Internet Explorer and Netscape Communicator, for example, support SSL and also avoid known
browser security vulnerabilities.

While using a UC Davis Web page, you may encounter hypertext links to the Web pages of organizations not
directly affiliated with UC Davis. UC Davis does not control the content or information practices of external
organizations. We recommend you review the privacy statements of these organizations.

Individual privacy rights and public disclosure of information: In the state of California, laws exist to ensure
that government is open and that the public has a right to access appropriate records and information
possessed by state government. At the same time, there are exceptions to the public's right to access public
records. These exceptions serve various needs including maintaining the privacy of individuals. Both state
and federal laws provide such exceptions to public access rights.

UC Davis respects both the right of public access to information and the right of privacy of individuals. All
information collected at this site becomes public record that may be subject to inspection and copying by the
public, unless an exemption in law exists. If any type of personal information is requested on the Web site or
volunteered by the user, State law, including the Information Practices Act of 1977 and the California Public
Records Act, and federal law, including the Privacy Act of 1974 and the Family Educational Rights and
Privacy Act of 1974, may protect it from disclosure to third parties.

In the event of a conflict between this privacy expectation and the Public Records Act, the Information
Practices Act, or other law governing the disclosure of records, the Public Records Act, the Information
Practices Act, or other applicable law will control. In addition, information may be produced in response to a
subpoena or court order.</SUBTEXT>
