        <SUBTITLE>IVW</SUBTITLE>
        <SUBTEXT>Our website uses the scalable central measurement method (SZM) by INFOnline for establishing statistical parameters for the utilisation of our products.
Anonymous readings are captured for this purpose. For recognising computer systems the measurement method for range uses either a cookie with the code  ivwbox.de or a signature which combines various pieces of information transferred automatically by your computer. This procedure does not store any IP addresses and processes them only in an anonymous form. Data protection was taken into account when the measurement method for range was developed. The aim of range measurement is to statistically establish the intensity of utilisation and the number of users of a website. Individual users are not identified at any stage. User identity always remains protected. Users do not receive any advertisements through this system. Utilisation statistics for web products which are part of the Informationsgemeinschaft zur Feststellung der Verbreitung von Werbeträgern e.V. (IVW - www.ivw.eu) [Audit Bureau of Circulations] or participate in the internet facts study conducted by the Arbeitsgemeinschaft Online-Forschung e.V. (AGOF - www.agof.de) [online research working group], are published monthly by AGOF and by the Arbeitsgemeinschaft Media-Analyse e.V. as well as by IVW and can be viewed at www.agof.de, at www.agma-mmc.de and  www.ivw.eu. Apart from publishing measurement data IVW monitors the SZM procedure in terms of utilisation which conforms to rules and data security. INFOnline GmbH operates the SZM procedure. Visit www.infonline.de for more information on SZM, as well as AGOF's data protection website at www.agof.de/datenschutz and IVW data protection at www.ivw.eu.

        <SUBTEXT>These internet pages use plug-ins of the facebook.com social network which is operated by Facebook Inc., 1601 S California Ave, Palo Alto, CA 94304 USA (“Facebook”). When you enter a site containing a plug-in, your browser establishes a direct connection to the Facebook servers. Facebook transfers the plug-in content directly to your browser which in turn ties it into the website. By incorporating plug-ins Facebook receives the information that you have entered the respective page of our website. If you are also logged into Facebook at that time, your visit to our site is allocated to your Facebook account. By interacting with the plug-ins (e.g. clicking the “like” button or adding commentary) your browser also transfers that information directly to Facebook, where it is stored. If you want to prevent this you have to log out of Facebook before you enter our pages.
For more details on the purpose and extent of data captured by Facebook, how it is processed and used, as well as your rights and possibilities to protect your privacy please see Facebook's information on data protection.
DocCheck has no influence on how your data are captured, processed and used by Facebook.

Google+
We have integrated opportunities for interaction with the Google Plus social network by Google Inc. (1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA) into our websites, in particular the +1 button which is recognisable by its symbol. When you enter one of our sites containing such a button, your browser establishes a direct connection to the Google servers, and your browser ties the button's content into the website. Without further interaction Google does not capture your data unless you are logged in with Google+. If you are logged in, Google+ will among other things capture and process/use your IP address and allocate it to your account. The same applies if you actively use the +1 button.

For further details and comprehensive information on the purpose and extent of data capturing, processing and utilisation by Google, as well as the possibilities of how to arrange your settings for privacy please see www.google.com/intl/com/policies/privacy/.
