        <SUBTITLE>OVERVIEW</SUBTITLE>
        <SUBTEXT>The Active Network, Inc. and its affiliated companies and subsidiaries (collectively, “ACTIVE,” “us”, “we” or “our”) value your privacy and are committed to protecting your personal information. ACTIVE is a leading provider of Activity and Participant Management™ solutions. Our flagship technology platform, ACTIVEWorks®, transforms the way organizers manage their activities and events by automating online registrations and streamlining other critical management functions, while also driving consumer participation to their events. Our websites include online communities for people who want to discover, participate in, and share activities about which they are passionate. Using our services, you'll be able to learn about upcoming events, and, in some circumstances, to register for those events and tell your friends about the events. Our services may also be used by organizations to provide you the ability to take certain actions. For example, we may create or host websites and mobile applications on the behalf of others that allow you to, among other things, register for a class or conference, make campsite reservations, purchase hunting or fishing licenses, or pay a parking ticket.

We also offer mobile applications that provide information about events in your area, permit you to register for races, make camping reservations, book tee times, create and download training programs, and enjoy many of the benefits of our websites, in addition to other services (collectively, “Applications”). In general, our Applications operate on an open network; that means that any information that you post to these Applications may be available to other users of the same application, and, in some instances, on our websites.

In this Privacy Policy (“Policy”), we describe the information that we collect from visitors to and users of our websites (“Sites”), our blogs, our Applications, and our online products and services (collectively, “Services”). By visiting our Sites or using any of our Services, you agree that your personal information will be handled as described in this Policy, which is incorporated by reference into the ACTIVE Terms of Service, available at http://www.activenetwork.com/information/terms-of-use.

ACTIVE has been awarded TRUSTe's Privacy and Children's Privacy Seal signifying that this Policy and our practices have been reviewed by TRUSTe for compliance with TRUSTe's Web Privacy, COPPA, and TRUSTed Cloud program requirements including transparency, accountability and choice regarding the collection and use of your personal information.

        <SUBTITLE>WHAT INFORMATION DO WE COLLECT ABOUT YOU AND WHY</SUBTITLE>
        <SUBTEXT>The information we collect from you allows you to log into our Sites; use our Services and Applications; and register for and/or set up registration for you or your organization's own customers for events, contests, camps, licenses, classes, tickets, facility/equipment use, transactions, sales, memberships, reservations, donations and/or activities (collectively, “Events”). We also collect information from businesses, organizations, and individuals who request information from ACTIVE.

Individuals and agents of individuals may provide us information directly or indirectly by registering for an Event or by otherwise using our Services (these individuals are referred to as “Consumers”). For example, you may enter your information in order to register for an Event, or someone who has organized a team may enter your information on your behalf to register your entire team. In addition, individuals or organizations can use our Services to set up Events for Consumers (those who use our Services to provide a service to Consumers are referred to as “Clients”). Relatedly, our Clients (including agents of our Clients) may provide us personal information about individuals who have registered for an Event being operated by our Client or who the Client wants us to contact or otherwise provide Services to on behalf of the Client.

Information We Collect Directly From You.

Account Information for our Sites. You may browse our Sites without creating an online account or providing us with your information, but to use certain features or to register for an Event, you may need to create an account or otherwise provide us with information. When you create an account with us or register for an Event, we may ask you to provide the following:

Your first and last name;
Your email address and your desired password;
Your display name (this is the name other people will see when you post items to one of our Sites or engage in other similar activities on our site);
Your date of birth;
Your subscription preferences (whether and what types of information you would like us to send you)
Information about your activities and interests;
Other profile data, such as contact information, occupation, gender and photo;
Your physical activities or similar health related information (how long you exercised, caloric intake or weight lost);
The contact of information of a friend (when inviting them to visit the Site);
Payment information, such as credit card or financial account numbers (if applicable).
Log in Information for our Sites. Once you have signed up for a particular ACTIVE Site, on subsequent visits to the same Site, you may simply need to enter your user ID or email address (as applicable) and password to gain access to the Site; however, for certain Sites, your login credentials will only gain you access to Events held by the particular Client with whom you originally registered. In some cases, you may be able to use your log in credentials to access multiple ACTIVE Sites.

Log in and Location Information for our Mobile Applications. When you first visit any of our Applications, you may have the option of creating a user ID and password for subsequent visits. When you log into certain of our Applications, we will request your permission to obtain your current location (so-called “geolocation” information) so that we can identify Events near you or to provide other location-related services. In the “settings” function on your phone, you will have the ability to manually permit or preclude us from recording your geolocation information for certain Applications or features of Applications, for example, so that we can track your running route, point you to an open ski slope, or help you to find a campground.

Events and Training Information. As a registered user of our Sites, you may be able to post information about upcoming Events. We may collect information from you if you choose to register for an Event or record your training activity. For some Events, you may register directly on our Sites and through our Applications; for other Events, we may provide a link that directs you to the sponsor or holder of the Event. The information that we collect about you may vary based on the Event, but generally includes the same type of information that you would include when creating an account with us. In addition, if the Event is a race or timed event, we may collect information related to tracking your performance (e.g., data collected by a race chip ID). If there is a charge to enter the Event, we may collect your credit card billing information, including your credit card number, expiration date, billing and shipping address, and other information necessary to process your payment.

Church Management Systems. With respect to our church management Services, when you attend a class, give to the church, request assistance, or your children are cared for, we may request additional information about you, however, you can choose not to provide us with such information. For example, Salvation date, Baptism date, and/or church membership/leadership classes attendance may be requested. As well, your testimony will be captured if you provide it. This information will be used solely in ways to understand on how to best meet you and your family's spiritual needs. Please see Charitable Events/Fundraising for our policy concerning charitable contributions to the church using Online Giving.

Charitable Events/Fundraising. You may create a page on certain of our Sites to collect donations for (i) your participation in a charity event (e.g., you want to raise money for running in a marathon), (ii) a particular charity, or (iii) for other purposes. We may collect information from you surrounding the charitable event or your request for donations. In addition, if you donate to a particular Event/cause, we may collect your name, contact information, and credit card information.

Contests, Surveys and Questionnaires. When you sign up for sweepstakes or contests, or complete questionnaires or surveys, we collect the information you submit to us. We use this information to administer the sweepstakes, contest or survey, to analyze the results, for research purposes, to send you other information or offers we think may be of interest to you, to comply with legal requirements, and for other purposes as discussed in this Policy.

Licenses, Reservations, Permits, and Fines. When you purchase hunting or fishing licenses, camping permits, or submit payment for fines, we may require additional information about you in order to complete your request. For example, we may need your driver's license number, social security number, or visa or passport number in order to verify your identity and process your request. In addition, we might collect public agency reservation information (e.g., information about your planned visit to a specific government agency-operated or government agency-administered campground or park, such as dates of stay or number of occupants, other than personal information). This information is used only as necessary in order to help complete your transaction.

Golf Tee Times. When you purchase or make a golf tee time reservation, you may be required to provide your name, your phone number, and you may be required to provide a credit card number to hold or process your reservation.

Suppliers of Services to Corporate Clients for Meeting Management. ACTIVE provides access to its Services via Sites to suppliers of services to corporate Clients (“Suppliers”). These Suppliers include hotels, convention and visitors bureaus, and destination management companies. Individuals and companies (“Buyers”) use ACTIVE's technology via Sites on behalf of corporate Clients to manage meetings, and to purchase services for these meetings and events from Suppliers. Attendees use the Services when invited by a corporate Client to attend a meeting. They do so by viewing a Site that contains questions created by the corporate Client. By responding to these questions, the attendee gives the corporate client information about the attendee and the attendee's plans for attending that specific meeting.

RFPs. When a Client submits a request for proposal (“RFP”) to a property or service provider listed through our Services, we will contact the applicable property or service provider and disclose information necessary to submit the RFP, which may contain personal information. The property or service provider will not have access to the Client's address book or information collected through the Service.

User Profiles, Comments and Posts. Some of our Sites and Applications allow users to create or post content, such as comments, profiles, blogs and messages. If you provide content to our Sites, we may collect and use that information as described in this Policy. Please note that such information may be viewed, collected or used by other registered users and public visitors to our Sites. Once posted, we cannot prevent such information from being used in a manner that may violate this Policy, the law or your personal privacy. Your profile, however, may offer privacy settings within your account to help you manage how your content is displayed.

Job Site References. As part of applying for employment with ACTIVE, we may ask you for information such as details regarding your education, employment history, qualifications, and the contact information of a former colleague's name. This information is used for job reference purposes only and is not used for any other purpose.

Information We Collect from Facebook. We may provide you with the opportunity to connect via Facebook, through our Sites or Applications. For example, you can indicate that you are going to participate in an Event and invite your Facebook friends to join that Event. If you log into Facebook through our Sites or Applications, we will request permission to (i) access your basic information, which includes your name, profile picture, gender, networks, Facebook user ID, list of friends and any other information that you have made public on Facebook; and (ii) manage your participation in Events (so that ACTIVE may RSVP on your behalf). For information about how Facebook may disclose your information, including any information you make public, please consult the Facebook Data Use Policy. We have no control over how Facebook uses or discloses the personal information you provide to it. We store the information that we receive from Facebook along with other information that we collect from you or receive about you.

Information We Collect About You From Third Parties. We also may collect information, including personally identifiable information, about you from our affiliates and non-affiliated third parties. For example, if you register for a race by clicking through our Sites, the sponsor of the race may provide us with your name and contact information; and, when the race is over, we also may obtain your race time.

Information We Collect Automatically. We may use cookies, web beacons, and other automated devices to collect information, including personally identifiable information, about you when you visit our Sites and receive emails from us.

In some of our email messages, we use a “click-through URL” linked to content on the ACTIVE website. When Customers click one of these URLs, they pass through a separate web server before arriving at the destination page on our Site. We track this click-through data to help us determine interest in particular topics and measure the effectiveness of our customer communications. If you prefer not to be tracked in this way, you should not click text or graphic links in the email messages. We also collect non-personal data (including, without limitation, of the type set forth above) from third parties. The information we collect from third parties may be combined with the information we collect. This information also may be associated with your username and combined with other information, including personally identifiable information that we collect about you.

        <SUBTITLE>HOW SECURE IS INFORMATION ABOUT ME</SUBTITLE>
        <SUBTEXT>We have implemented commercially reasonable precautions, including, where appropriate, password protection, encryption, and secure socket layering to protect our Sites and the information we collect from loss, misuse and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction.

We may decline to process requests that are unreasonably repetitive, require disproportionate technical effort, jeopardize the privacy of others, are extremely impractical, or for which access is not otherwise required by local law.

If your information has been shared with a third party, as described above, or collected on behalf of a Client, then that third party has received their own copy of your data.

Further, if you opt out of receiving information related to a particular Event, you will still receive ACTIVE communications and communications from other organizers whose Events you have attended or are registered to attend or who have otherwise obtained your email address.

By electing to stop receiving all communications from us or through our system you will no longer receive any updates on your account or on Events you are registered to attend or have previously attended, including communications regarding refunds. We do not recommend that you do this unless you plan to no longer use the Services, are not currently registered for an Event, are not currently organizing an Event and will have no need to receive further communications from us or through our system. Even after you opt out of all communications, we will retain your information in accordance with this Policy, however, we will no longer use it to contact you. However, our Clients who have received your information in accordance with this Policy may still use that information to contact you in accordance with their own privacy policies, but they may not use our system to do so.
