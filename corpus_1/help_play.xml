        <SUBTEXT>We operate an 'Email a friend' service. This is a referral service, designed to make it easy for customers to recommend our Site and related websites or offers to a friend, and is a two-step process. First, a customer sends us the friend's name and email address, and secondly, we contact the friend, telling them who we are, and inviting them to take advantage of a particular offer, or to visit our website. When we contact your friend, we always advise them of the name and email address of the friend who made the original referral. We will not use your friend's details for any other purpose.

When a customer wishes to sponsor a friend and provides us with his/her name and e-mail address, we reasonably assume that such customer has obtained his/her friend's prior consent in order for us to process his/her data. Customers supply such information freely and voluntarily, under their sole responsibility.</SUBTEXT>
