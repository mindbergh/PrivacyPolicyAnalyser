        <SUBTITLE>What information does OfficeMax collect?</SUBTITLE>
        <SUBTEXT>Through its Web Sites, OfficeMax collects "Personally Identifiable Information" which is any information that can be used to specifically identify an individual, such as your name, mailing address, e-mail address, telephone number, social security number or credit card number. Users may provide us with Personally Identifiable Information and certain demographic information (such as gender, zip code, hometown or similar information) through Web Site features, including, surveys, online registration forms, sweepstakes entries and bulletin boards. Additionally, when you visit our Web Sites our servers automatically collect certain information from you, such as the number of pages viewed and accessed, browser type and IP address.

We also collect purchasing information from you when you make a purchase on one of the Web Sites.

This information may include:

A few of the Tracking Technologies, include, without limitation, the following (and subsequent technology and methods later developed):
Cookies. Cookies are small data files that are transferred to your computer (or other Internet-accessing device) when you visit the Web Sites. Cookies allow us to improve and enhance the Web Site and serve users more appropriate content. Most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies but you can reset your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent by indicating this in the preferences or options menu in your browser. However, it is possible that some parts of the Web Sites will not operate correctly if you disable cookies and you may not be able to take advantage of some of this Web Sites' features. You should consult with your browser's provider/manufacturer if you have any questions regarding disabling cookies.
Web Beacons. The Web Sites and any communications sent by the Web Sites may contain electronic images (generally, single-pixel ".gif" images) called "web beacons." These web beacons allow OfficeMax and third parties to monitor and collect certain information about the viewer of the web page, web-based document, e-mail message or other communication, such as the type of browser requesting the web beacon and the time the web beacon was viewed. We may use web beacons or similar technologies for a number of purposes, such as and without limitation, to count visitors to our web pages or to monitor how our users navigate this Web Sites and to count how many e-mails (or particular articles, links, etc.) we sent were actually opened.
Embedded Scripts. The Web Sites may also utilize embedded scripts which is programming code that is designed to collect information about your interactions with the Web Sites. The script is temporarily downloaded onto your computer from our web server or a third party service provider, is active only while you are connected to the Web Sites, and is deleted thereafter.
ETag, or entity tag. A feature of the cache in browsers. It is an opaque identifier assigned by a web server to a specific version of a resource found at a URL. If the resource content at that URL ever changes, a new and different ETag is assigned. Used in this manner ETags are a form of Device Identifier. ETag tracking may generate unique tracking values even where the consumer blocks HTTP, Flash, and/or HTML5 cookies.
We may use Tracking Technologies for a variety of purposes, including as follows:
Strictly Necessary. We may use cookies or other Tracking Technologies that we consider are strictly necessary to allow you to use and access our Service, including cookies required to prevent fraudulent activity, improve security or allow you to make use of shopping cart functionality.

        <SUBTITLE>What should I know about ads?</SUBTITLE>
        <SUBTEXT>We may use third parties such as network advertisers and ad exchanges to serve advertisements across the Internet and may use third party analytics service providers to evaluate and provide us and/or third parties with information about the use of these ads on third party sites and viewing of ads and of our content. Network advertisers are third parties that display advertisements, which may be based on your activities across the Internet and mobile media ("Behavioral Ads"). In addition, we may serve ads on our Web Sites based on your usage information ("Contextual Ads"). Behavioral Ads and Contextual Ads enable us to target advertisements to you for products and services in which you might be interested. If you object to Contextual Ads, do not use our Web Sites. If you object to receiving Behavioral Ads from us on third party sites, you can learn more about your ability to limit Behavioral Ads below.
Our third party ad network and exchange providers, the advertisers, the sponsors and/or traffic measurement services may themselves set and access their own cookies (including Flash cookies), web beacons and other Tracking Technologies on your Device and track certain behavioral usage information regarding users of your Device via a Device Identifier. These third party Tracking Technologies may be set to, among other things: (a) help deliver advertisements to you that you might be interested in; (b) prevent you from seeing the same advertisements too many times; and (c) understand the usefulness to you of the advertisements that have been delivered to you.
OfficeMax offers you choices about receiving interest-based ads that come directly from us. To opt-out of targeted related advertising provided by OfficeMax, click here. If you opt-out, you may still see OfficeMax targeted ads on third party sites for reasons further explained below.
Third-party Tracking Technologies are not controlled by us, even those used to serve our ads. Statements regarding our practices do not apply to the methods for collecting information used by these third party advertisers and others or the use of the information that such third parties collect. We do however work with third parties to make efforts to have you provided with information on their practices and any available opportunity to exercise choice. The relevant third party's terms of service, privacy policy, permissions, notices and choices should be reviewed regarding their collection, storage and sharing practices. We make no representations regarding the policies or practices of third party advertisers or advertising networks or exchanges or related third parties.
However, some third parties may offer you certain choices regarding their practices, and information we have been informed of regarding such choices is available here. Further, while we and third party sites may use a variety of companies to serve advertisements, you may wish to visit http://www.networkadvertising.org/optout_nonppii.asp, which provides information regarding this practice by Network Advertising Initiative ("NAI") members, and your choices regarding having this information used by these companies, including the "opt-out" procedures of NAI members. Opting out of one or more NAI members only means that those NAI members no longer will be allowed under their own rules to deliver Behavioral Ads to you, but does not mean you will no longer receive any targeted content and/or ads. Also, if your browsers are configured to reject cookies when you visit this opt-out page, or you subsequently erase your cookies, use a different Device or change web browsers, your NAI opt-out may not, or may no longer, be effective. Additional information is available on the NAI's web site accessible by the above link. You may also opt-out of receiving Behavioral Ads on participating sites and services by visiting the Digital Advertising Alliance ("DAA") website at http://www.aboutads.info/choices/#completed. Similar limitations may apply to the DAA opt-out. We are not responsible for effectiveness of or compliance with any third parties' opt-out options or programs.
