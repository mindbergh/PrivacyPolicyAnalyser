2.2 Using the internet to collect and process Information necessarily involves the transmission of Information on an international basis. Some third party processors we engage to process Information on our behalf may be based outside the European Economic Area ("EEA"). Therefore, by browsing our Websites and communicating electronically with us, you acknowledge and agree to the transmission and processing of your Information outside the EEA in this way. Countries outside the EEA do not always have strong data protection laws. However, we will always take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that your Information is used by third party processors securely and in accordance with this policy.

2.3 Except where we engage third parties to process your Information on our behalf for the purposes listed in paragraph 2.1 above, we will not disclose or sell your Information outside Ladbrokes' corporate group, except in connection with a joint venture or the proposed or actual sale of the whole or part of Ladbrokes' business.

        <SUBTITLE>Use of Cookies</SUBTITLE>
        <SUBTEXT>5.1 A 'cookie' is a small text file containing small amounts of information which is downloaded to your device when you visit a website or use applications. The cookie enables the server to collect information from the browser.

5.2 We use the cookies on our Websites for a number of purposes, including:

to authenticate and identify you on our Websites and applications so we can provide you with the services you request;
to allow you to login to the Websites and to check that your computer is still logged in to the same session while you browse from page to page. While placing bets, Information will be temporarily stored in a cookie until the transaction has been completed. This enables you to get the most out of our products and services. Further, various other settings, such as the language and odds display that you have selected, are stored in cookies for a longer duration so that when you return to the Websites as many of these settings as possible remain the same;
to automatically collect Information about bets and account transactions carried out on our Websites;
for ‘analytical' purposes such as to keep track of user/customer browsing patterns on the Websites and to build up a profile for a customised browser experience for you. We currently use Google Analytics, a popular web analytics service provided by Google, Inc. Google Analytics uses cookies to help us to analyse how users use our Websites. We also use analytical cookies from additional third party providers;
to deliver adverts and information more relevant to you and your interests and also to help measure the effectiveness of Ladbrokes' advertising campaigns; and
to compile reports on Website activity and providing other services relating to Website activity and internet usage. We may also transfer this information to third parties where required to do so by law, or where such third parties process the information on Ladbrokes' behalf.
5.3 We use flash, session and persistent cookies on our Websites and applications. Flash cookies are small pieces of information stored and accessed by Adobe Flash, the browser plug-in used by sites. Session cookies are used by the server to store information about user page activities so users can easily pick up where they left off on the server's pages. Persistent cookies enable a website to remember you on subsequent visits, speeding up or enhancing your experience of services or functions required.

5.4 You can stop the 'tracking' cookies by altering your browser's privacy setting to block third party cookies (the process you follow will differ from browser to browser). To find out how to manage and/or delete cookies, please visit: www.aboutcookies.org. However, please note that if you do refuse the use of cookies, you may not be able to use the full functionality of Ladbrokes' Websites – for example, a cookie is needed to ‘remember' your bet selection when it is transferred to the bet slip. Further, if you set the privacy settings on too high a status, this may cause problems when you next log in to use the Websites.</SUBTEXT>

        <SUBTITLE>Security and privacy</SUBTITLE>
        <SUBTEXT>6.1 We employ security measures to protect your Information from access by unauthorised persons and to prevent unlawful processing, accidental loss, destruction and damage. Protection of your Information, including your registration details and any debit or credit card information you provide to us, is a priority for us. Data on our secure pages is encrypted using Secure Sockets Layer ("SSL") technology. Where we have given you (or where you have chosen) a password which enables you to access certain parts of our Websites, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential.

6.2 Any personal information which identifies you will be encrypted at all times whilst in transit over the internet. SSL is special protocol that automatically encrypts any information sent by you on our secure pages. Our server then reads the information using a private key. This means that your Information, be it debit or credit card information or any other personal details, is turned into a code that can only be decoded with the private key or password. If your browser is suitably configured, you will receive a warning message when you first access any secure page on the Website. This is simply information to advise you that the Website is protecting your Information.

6.3 Unfortunately, the transmission of Information via the internet is not completely secure. Although Ladbrokes will do its best to protect your Information as described in paragraph 6.2 above, it cannot guarantee the security of any Information that you disclose online. You accept the inherent security implications of using the internet and will not hold us responsible for any breach of security unless we have been negligent. For your own privacy protection, we encourage you not to include sensitive Information (such as credit/debit card numbers) in any emails you may send to us.

6.4 Our Websites may, from time to time, contain links to and from the websites of our partner networks, advertisers and affiliates. If you follow a link to any of these websites, please note that these websites may have their own privacy policies/website terms of use and we do not accept any responsibility or liability for these policies. Please check such policies before you submit any Information to them.</SUBTEXT>

Other Information will be retained for the period necessary to fulfil the purposes set out in paragraph 2.1 unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by applicable law. We will take all reasonable steps to ensure that the privacy of Information is maintained on disposal.</SUBTEXT>

    <SECTION>
        <SUBTITLE>Changes to our policy</SUBTITLE>

        <SUBTITLE>Accuracy and access to Information</SUBTITLE>
        <SUBTEXT>9.1 We will take all reasonable steps to ensure that any Information that we collect from you is accurate and has been verified.

9.2 You are entitled to see the Information held about you and you may ask us to make any necessary changes to ensure that it is accurate and kept up to date. We are entitled by law to make a small administrative charge for providing such Information.
