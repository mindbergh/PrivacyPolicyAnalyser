        <SUBTITLE>YOUR CALIFORNIA PRIVACY RIGHTS</SUBTITLE>
        <SUBTEXT>Residents of the State of California, under certain provisions of the California Civil Code, have the right to request from companies conducting business in California a list of all third parties to which the company has disclosed personally identifiable information during the preceding year for direct marketing purposes. Alternatively, the law provides that if the company has a Privacy Policy that gives either an opt-out or opt-in choice for use of your personally identifiable information by third parties (such as advertisers) for marketing purposes, the company may instead provide you with information on how to exercise your disclosure choice options.

Universal Uclick has opted for the alternative option and therefore it has a comprehensive Privacy Policy and provides you with details on how you may opt-out or opt-in to the use of your personally identifiable information by third parties for direct marketing purposes. Therefore, we are not required to maintain or disclose a list of third parties that received your personally identifiable information for marketing purposes.</SUBTEXT>

We may do this to provide you with services, tailor our content to you or present you with a chance to purchase products or services that may be of interest to you. We may combine information received from third parties with information we collect through the Web Site. In those cases, we will apply this Privacy Policy to any personal identifiable information received from third parties, unless we tell you otherwise at the time you provide us with your personally identifiable information.

We Collect Information As You Access And Use The Web Site

We may collect certain non-personally identifiable information related to your usage of the Web Site and how you arrived at the Web Site (“Usage Information”), which may include a visitor's "IP Address" (discussed below) or another unique identifier for a device used to access the Internet, operating system, browser type, referring web site URL. This Usage Information allows us, among other things, to calculate the number of visitors to the Web Site, diagnose problems with the Web Site's server and operate the Web Site. Usage Information may also be used to tailor and improve the Web Site, serve you relevant content and/or advertising at the Web Site and serve you an appropriate version of a web page.

ip address

An IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to you whenever you access the Internet and is often associated with the place where you enter the Internet like your ISP (“Internet Service Provider”), your company or your university. This IP address may be the same each time you access the Internet or it may change.

the web site uses cookies and web beacons

Web pages at the Web Site may utilize cookies, which are small data files that your web browser places on your computer (or other Internet-accessing device) when you visit a web site. These cookies may allow us to collect information to tailor your user interface and facilitate your navigation of the Web Site. Your browser may allow you to reject cookies. However, the Web Site may not function properly if you reject cookies. We do not typically save Personal Information in cookies, but we may link cookies to any information we collect. The Web Site may also use web beacons, clear gifs, pixel tags or technologies (as they become available), which allow Universal Uclick and third parties to monitor and collect certain information about the viewer of a web page, web-based document or message sent by the Web Site, such as browser type. We use the information collected though these technologies for a variety of purposes, such as to serve you relevant content and/or advertising at the Web Site, count Web Site visitors and monitor Web Site traffic patterns.

the web site uses embedded scripts

Scripts and other programming code used in the Web Site may collect non-personally identifiable information regarding use of the Web Site, such as web pages visited, for how long they are visited and which links are clicked. We may use this information for a number of purposes, for example, to enhance or customize content served to users of the Web Site.

third-party ad serving &amp; audience and traffic measurement services

The Web Site may use third party network advertisers to serve advertisements on the Web Site and may use a traffic measurement service to analyze traffic on the Web Site. Network advertisers are third parties that display advertisements based on your visits to the Web Site and other web sites you have visited. Third-party ad serving enables us to target advertisements to you for products and services in which you might be interested. Although advertisers and other companies do not have access to cookies set by the Web Site, the Web Site's third party ad network providers, the advertisers, the sponsors, and/or traffic measurement services may themselves set and access their own cookies and technologies on your computer. These third party cookies and/or technologies may be set to, among other things, help deliver advertisements to you that you might be interested in, to prevent you from seeing the same advertisements too many times and to conduct research regarding the usefulness of certain advertisements to you. Note that any images (or any other parts of a web page) served by third parties in association with third party cookies and/or technologies may serve as web beacons, which enable third parties to carry out the previously described activities. Third party cookies, web beacons and other technologies are governed by each third party's specific privacy policy, not this one. While we may use a variety of companies to serve advertisements on the Web Site, you may wish to visit http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp, which provides information regarding the “opt-out” procedures of certain third party ad servers we may use.</SUBTEXT>
