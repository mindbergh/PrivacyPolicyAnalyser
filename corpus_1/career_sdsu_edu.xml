        <SUBTITLE>Privacy &amp; Data Management Statements</SUBTITLE>
        <SUBTEXT>SDSU Career Services is committed to maintaining good privacy practices regarding electronic personal information for all our users. All data collected for our job listing/resume database and on-campus recruiting services are stored on NACElink secure servers. Information collected is used to provide and tailor services to our users. It is also used to construct aggregate reports that assist us in program planning.
The system for providing the job listing/resume database and the on-campus recruiting service uses “cookies” and may collect system information such as IP address and browser version. This system is provided by SDSU Career Services in partnership with two non-profit associations – the National Association of Colleges and Employers (NACE) and DirectEmployers Association, Inc. All privacy policies for our partners have been reviewed by Career Services and are accessible through the links at the bottom of each page of our website.
NACElink does not review job postings. Neither NACE, Symplicity (the software provider), nor DirectEmployers (for the NACElink Alumni Network) review job postings on individual school web sites or nacelink.com. Site users are urged to validate job postings and use caution and common sense when applying. Do not disclose Social Security numbers, credit card information, or bank account numbers with unknown employers.
Collection and access to student information is governed by campus and federal policy under the Federal Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (SDSU FERPA statement), as well as the SDSU Acceptable Use Policy and Computing Security Policy. All of our users' information is considered confidential and its use is restricted to SDSU Career Services staff, on an as-needed basis.
If you have any questions, concerns, or comments regarding this Privacy Policy or privacy issues relating to Aztec Career Connection, please contact us.</SUBTEXT>
